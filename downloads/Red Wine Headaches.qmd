Do you get a headache after drinking red wine?  UCSF researchers [think it's from](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67449509) how your body reacts to the antioxidant or flavanol called quercetin.

Quercetin, found in higher quantities in expensive wines, is also available as a supplement.

Here's how a personal scientist can test if the quercetin connection is the reason for your headaches:

1. Drink a form of alcohol that *doesn't* include any quercetin.
2. Take a quercetin supplement.

If you get a headache, then you've proven why.

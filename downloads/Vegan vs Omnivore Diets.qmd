[Nina Teicholz](https://unsettledscience.substack.com/p/stanfords-vegan-twin-study-science?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=email) does a takedown on an 8-week RCT ( [Cardiometabolic Effects of Omnivorous vs Vegan Diets in Identical Twins](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2812392?resultClick=3)) that claims a vegan diet is better than an omnivore one.

She notes all the apparent conflicts of interest by the researchers:  Stanford's Christopher Gardner and Tim Spector (makers of ZOE).

I'm less worried about financial conflicts of interest, since I'm generally a trusting soul who thinks these researchers need to get their money *somewhere* and I think they can be reasonably honest in their results. I have a hard time imaging  anybody could sleep at night knowing he deliberately fudged data to make his funders happy. I'm sure it happens, but my first instinct is not to immediately discredit some result just because money is involved.

There are a *lot* of ways to have "conflict of interest" that don't involve money. Heck, if you're a researcher who might not make tenure if your experimental results don't go your way -- that seems like as big a conflict of interest as anything financial.  But it happens in the life of literally every reseacher, and we seem to ignore it.

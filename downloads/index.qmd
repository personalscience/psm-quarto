Science is the systematic and open-minded pursuit of truth through a never-ending process of systematic experimentation.  It's open to everyone and can be applied to any situation, including situations that affect you right now. It's _Personal Science_ when you use the scientific method to discover important insights about the wellness and performance of yourself and those around you. 

This book will introduce you to one exciting area of personal science: understanding your own microbiome. It's based on my own experiences collecting and studying hundreds of my own samples, and thousands from other people. Learn everything I did, and how you can do it yourself.

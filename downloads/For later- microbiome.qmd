## Beyond Microbes

Stanford University biologist Ivan Zheludev searched millions of published genome and identified at least 30K different Obelisks that appeared in about 10\% of the samples.

It's RNA with only 1000 nucleotides.

> We systematically developed a statistical monitoring diagram for personalized health status prediction and analysis. Our framework comprises three elements: (1) a statistical monitoring model was established, the health index was constructed, and the health boundary was defined; (2) healthy patterns were identified among healthy people and analyzed using contrast learning; (3) the contribution of each bacterium to the health index of the diseased population was analyzed. Furthermore, we investigated disease proximity using the contribution spectrum and discovered multiple multi-disease-related targets.

## Eye Disease and Gut Microbiome

[Some inherited eye diseases, including blindness](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2024/feb/blindness-some-inherited-eye-diseases-may-be-caused-gut-bacteria) may be caused by gut bacteria that 

> RB1 gene is key to controlling the integrity of the lower gastrointestinal tract, the first ever such observation. There, it combats pathogens and harmful bacteria by regulating what passes between the contents of the gut and the rest of the body.
> 
> The team found that when the gene has a particular mutation, dampening its expression (reducing its effect), these barriers in both the retina and the gut can be breached, enabling bacteria in the gut to move through the body and into the eye, leading to lesions in the retina that cause sight loss.

The research was conducted on mice by Professor Richard Lee (UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust).

does it have an association with microbes?

> Now, a new study from an interdisciplinary team has taken important steps to understanding stone age bacteria by sequencing genomes recovered from ancient dental calculus. The hardened tartar preserved bacterial fragments on the teeth of 12 Neanderthals and 34 humans that had lived anywhere from 102,000 to 150 years ago. Formed from plaque, this calculus fossilized during these humans’ lifetime, trapping genetic fragments inside.

## Methods

[Greengenes2 unifies microbial data in a single reference tree](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372684035_Greengenes2_unifies_microbial_data_in_a_single_reference_tree)
> Studies using 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomics typically yield different results, usually attributed to PCR amplification biases. We introduce Greengenes2, a reference tree that unifies genomic and 16S rRNA databases in a consistent, integrated resource. By inserting sequences into a whole-genome phylogeny, we show that 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic data generated from the same samples agree in principal coordinates space, taxonomy and phenotype effect size when analyzed with the same tree.

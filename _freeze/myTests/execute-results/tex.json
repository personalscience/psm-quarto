Each of us has a unique oral microbiome, and scientists were able to that that this inter-person variability is large enough to explain at least some of the differences in how each of us perceive a glass of wine.\n\n\nWhat are the most important species in my mouth?\n\nTo microbes, your body looks like a hollow tube: skin on the outside, gut on the inside, and a mouth to allow passage between the two. Like purgatory, the mouth is a gatekeeper where new microbes wait before being whisked into the heavenly warm breeding grounds of the digestive system. But it's no easy waiting room either - the mouth contains many highly-distinct eco-systems, each as different from one another as the Sahara desert is to the bottom of the ocean. Most microbiome and genetic tests ask you to swab the inside of the cheek - an easy, straightforward place teeming with bacteria, but the bacteria in the cheeks can be very different from those on the tongue or the lips. I tested them all one morning right after waking up.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/mouthshow_77e2e46e1617590b82573b01e7ca4370'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r|r}\n\\hline\n  & Lips & Tongue & Cheek (Right) & Cheek (Left)\\\\\n\\hline\nStreptococcus & 57.36 & 6.44 & 38.41 & 43.42\\\\\n\\hline\nHaemophilus & 19.61 & 4.97 & 6.36 & 7.59\\\\\n\\hline\nGemella & 8.47 & 2.23 & 10.67 & 12.64\\\\\n\\hline\nActinobacillus & 3.07 & 0.26 & 3.91 & 3.32\\\\\n\\hline\nVeillonella & 2.14 & 7.70 & 1.81 & 2.20\\\\\n\\hline\nGranulicatella & 1.60 & 0.88 & 2.13 & 2.36\\\\\n\\hline\nNeisseria & 1.47 & 14.91 & 7.51 & 4.12\\\\\n\\hline\nFusobacterium & 1.24 & 14.99 & 5.94 & 6.96\\\\\n\\hline\nPorphyromonas & 1.10 & 3.37 & 3.56 & 2.78\\\\\n\\hline\nRothia & 0.90 & 0.21 & 6.49 & 2.83\\\\\n\\hline\nActinomyces & 0.69 & 2.26 & 2.90 & 2.11\\\\\n\\hline\nPrevotella & 0.45 & 13.31 & 1.09 & 1.73\\\\\n\\hline\nAlloprevotella & 0.42 & 2.76 & 0.46 & 0.36\\\\\n\\hline\nLeptotrichia & 0.22 & 8.20 & 1.64 & 1.96\\\\\n\\hline\nCapnocytophaga & 0.20 & 3.87 & 0.59 & 0.64\\\\\n\\hline\nPasteurella & 0.10 & 0.02 & 2.28 & 0.87\\\\\n\\hline\nLachnoanaerobaculum & 0.04 & 1.19 & 0.09 & 0.19\\\\\n\\hline\nCampylobacter & 0.03 & 2.05 & 0.39 & 0.50\\\\\n\\hline\nJohnsonella & 0.02 & 1.43 & 0.07 & 0.12\\\\\n\\hline\nBacteroides & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.95 & 0.23\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\nDramatic differences in the types of microbes in each part of the mouth.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWhile there is some variation in the cheeks, there is a dramatic difference between them and the lips or tongue.

Beginning in December 2016 and for no apparent reason, my mouth was colonized suddenly by a particular species of _Streptococcus_ that had not been there before. Why? I'm not aware of any major lifestyle or other changes to cause this: same toothpaste, same living conditions. A few dietary experiments here and there, but nothing that coincides with these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/fig-mouthStrep_2eb05d82636ca335b6ca4ddf24498d33'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nAt the species level, I eliminated all samples with under 10,000 reads.  We see something interesting: for no apparent reason, the species of _Streptococcus_ detected in my mouth has changed. Suddenly, in December 2016 my mouth was colonized by a particular species that had not been there before. Why? I hadn't done anything special; I'm not aware of any major lifestyle or other changes to cause this.\n\nI confirmed with the lab that it's not contamination.\nWhat's especially odd is that I experienced a shift like this twice now in one year. After comfortably floating along with Species _Streptococcus sp. BS35a_ for more than six months, suddenly in August the balance shifted again, this time to _Streptococcus sp. 11aTha1_. Will it shift again? Who knows?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/fig-mouth_passenger_d8af9de71d23f9ca46557916053aa287'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Odd shifts in some streptococcus species over time.](myTests_files/figure-pdf/fig-mouth_passenger-1.pdf){#fig-mouth_passenger}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI confirmed with the lab that it's not contamination. \n\nWhat's _especially_ odd is that I experienced a shift like this *twice* now in one year. After comfortably floating along with Species _Streptococcus sp. BS35a_ for more than six months, suddenly in August the balance shifted again, this time to _Streptococcus sp. 11aTha1_. Will it shift again? Who knows?\n\nEarth's atmosphere was originally void of oxygen, a poisonous gas to the first, so-called \"anaerobic\" bacteria who thrived precisely because there was no oxygen. Over eons, as oxygen levels increased these microbes found places to hide: deep, dark pockets inside multicellular creatures who traded an oxygen-free interior for the abundant, exotic metabolites the microbes could synthesize. In humans, these bacterial safe-houses begin in the mouth, where the oxygen is low enough to keep the lights on for the anaerobes, while allowing occasional blooms for the aerobic bacteria that thrive whenever the mouth is open and they find fresh air.\n\nMost of them do apparently need moisture: your salivary glands, strategically located in your cheeks and at the bottom of the mouth, churn out 1–2 liters of saliva per day.\n\nThe complexity of the mouth microbiome is compounded by the variety of surfaces, hard and soft, each with its own propensity to allow the formation of biofilms, tenacious clusters that protect microbes against invaders. On teeth, we call it dental plaque, a favorite protective breeding ground of _Streptococcus mutans_, the cavity-causing villain that, once established, is hard to dislodge. I'm fortunate that my mouth microbiome appears to have none of this and it's true that I never have cavities. I've seen levels as high as 2% in some people, who have to visit the dentist no matter how much they brush.\n\nMost microbes go down the hatch to the stomach, of course, but overly-aggressive tooth brushing or dental work can let a few can sneak into the bloodstream directly, where they can find their way to the lungs, the liver, or the heart, sometimes with deadly consequences. The \"viridans\" streptococci are one well-studied example: beneficial in the mouth, they outcompete other streptococcus enough to prevent strep throat, yet are the leading cause of heart valve infections if they make it into the bloodstream.\n\nThese mouth microbes have other interesting properties that may affect much more than we think. When scientists added an odorless compound from wine to a culture of known oral bacteria, the bacteria generated compounds that we can smell: terpenes, benzenic compounds and lipid derivatives.^[@munoz-gonzalez_ability_2015] Each of us has a unique oral microbiome, and the experimenters were able to show that this inter-person variability is large enough to explain at least some of the differences in how each of us perceive a glass of wine.\n\nSo what about these odd new ones that showed up in my mouth?\n\nI've looked up their names in every reference I can think of, but have found nothing. That's not too surprising: about a third of oral microbes are known only by their gene sequences.^[https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2016.865.pdf] The most satisfying answer from a microbiology expert I consulted is that these are likely to be \"passenger microbes\", doing nothing in particular helpful or harmful.\n\nIn other words, like so many other microbes in our environment, they are just along for the ride.\n\n## My Nose Microbiome {#startNose}\n\nSpringtime for many people brings hay fever, an allergic reaction [known to be associated with the microbiome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5378446/). I fortunately don't suffer from the condition, but I wondered if maybe I could find something in my nose microbiome that would show a seasonal shift, perhaps something aligned with allergy season. Even if I don't have symptoms, maybe by finding some of the key microbes involved my data might be useful to others who would like to explore more of the link between their allergies and microbes.\n\nLike every place on the body, your nose has its own unique microbial ecology, as different from other sites as a tropical rainforest is from the artic tundra. Unlike the gut or the mouth, your nose is in constant contact with the external environment, exposed to new microbes that float in day and night with every breath you take. \n\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to expect that we'd see different microbes floating in our environment as the seasons shift. After all, changes in temperature, humidity, and daylight affect the abundance and variety of plants, so of course these shifts will affect microbes.  But is there a pattern to the changes?\n\nTo find out, I sampled my nose microbiome more than 50 times over a period of three years, carefully tracking the date and microbial species in each sample. In all, I found more than 200 different (genus-level) bacteria from about 350 unique species.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/noseFunctions_8d59528f7ec3aa6402f4c1a5d6f1b38d'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/studyNose_6d17710d6cebd8a23b17270a3b47d3b3'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/plotSeasonality_a6ebcbb1abfd6128c326ce0feab34dc9'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nUsing a versatile clustering algorithm called [non-metric multidimension scaling (NMDS)](https://jonlefcheck.net/2012/10/24/nmds-tutorial-in-r/), I calculated the statistical correlations among the hundreds of microbes in a way that let me build a two-dimension chart where similar samples are clustered together, and less-similar samples are further apart. Where there are significant differences among samples, an NMDS chart will show obvious clustering, with similar samples bunched together and separate from other clusters. \n\nI couldn't see any patterns when I generated an NMDS clustering diagram on the whole data set, which includes samples taken in multiple geographies.  When I looked only at those samples taken in a single geography, my home , the results were a little more, well, consistent with a theory that seasons matter. (Figure \\@ref(fig:nosePlotSeasonalityGeo))\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/nosePlotSeasonalityGeo_5ed755d26a30107cbb09d0b513ee2dc9'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Nose microbiome across seasons in a single geography.](myTests_files/figure-pdf/nosePlotSeasonalityGeo-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/nosePlotSeasonalityDiversityGeo_5b4df3fd714a982bdc4e5ba263b98d98'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Nose microbiome diversity in a single geography by season.](myTests_files/figure-pdf/nosePlotSeasonalityDiversityGeo-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOkay, this chart is kind of a mess.  If there were major shifts, we'd see clear clusters.  Although we don't quite see that, it _is_ interesting that the seasons _do_ kinda-sorta hang together with much overlap. For example, the (red) winter dots are all on the right side of the chart, with the (blue) summer dots mostly on the left. The (purple) fall dots are, if anything, closer to the winter samples, and (green) spring is closer to summer. Both spring and fall were more in the middle, which you might kinda-sorta expect given that they are generally less extreme than the other two seasons.\n\nImportantly, each of the samples was taken under the same conditions: I swabbed the nostrils for about 30 seconds right after waking up each morning. Since my bedroom is kept at a climate-controlled temperature year-round, these samples wouldn't show direct results of major seasonal changes, though microbes in my bedroom are presumably affected somewhat by what's happening outdoors. I also have a number of samples taken in different geographies while traveling, but I removed them before making this chart.\n\nWhat about the richness and diversity of microbes throughout the year?  The box plot in (Figure \\@ref(fig:nosePlotSeasonalityDiversityGeo)) shows that summer has the widest diversity _range_ (those dots outside the main box are outliers).  In this plot, the area in the box represents 50% of the samples, and the line through the middle is the median diversity.\n\n\nI spend more time indoors in the winter, so perhaps that explains why median diversity is lowest then. Again, it's interesting that both spring and fall have similar diversities to each other, perhaps because both seasons have similar amounts of indoor-outdoor time and maybe the variety of microbes reflect that.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/unnamed-chunk-6_1314985abb55b1a2edbffcbc18d8bf17'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nIs it just me?

I tried taking high-omega 3 fish oil pills for a week.

They found that it increased the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes by a significant amount. How about me?\n\nInterestingly, looking back through my daily microbiome samples to see which dates I tried Soylent, I got this: (Figure \\@ref(fig:experimentSoylentFBRatio))\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/experimentSoylentFBRatio_7a16e2b15d59fded6f0815a80f260c56'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Red dots mark days when I drank Soylent.](myTests_files/figure-pdf/experimentSoylentFBRatio-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe red dots are dates when I drank Soylent.^[More precisely, the sample taken that day represents the food I ate the day _before_. In other words, the red dots are the *day after* I drank Soylent.] Unfortunately, the samples failed on two of the dates in this chart, so I'm unable to see how my gut microbiome looked immediately before taking the Soylent, but still, isn't it strange that my F/B ratio was reasonably stable until then?\n\nThe shift is more dramatic if we look at a longer time frame, the weeks before and after the Soylent drinking (Figure \\@ref(fig:soylentFBratio))\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/soylentFBratio_dcefc3a7ee6f886983b2ab52357b4ac9'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Soylent-drinking days are highlighted in red.](myTests_files/figure-pdf/soylentFBratio-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis is by no means a confirmation of the results of their experiment, since mine was just an _ad hoc_ test for two days among many other types of food-eating and tests that I regularly conduct on myself. That said, it is odd that I find a significant shift in that ratio, in the same direction as in their published trial.^[Important technical note: the study authors didn't use the standard uBiome bioinformatics pipeline (like I did), choosing instead to build their data from the raw FASTQ files returned from the uBiome 16S sequencing lab. That would normally make a significant difference in the results, so compare my data points with caution. Still...]\n\nWhy would this be?\n\nThe nutritional label gives some possible clues. (Figure \\@ref(fig:experimentSoylentLabel))\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/experimentSoylentLabel_165a4e9eca41fd13da3481aac683b6e4'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Nutritional label and ingredients list from a bottle of Soylent.](Experiments/assets/MHG-experimentSoylentLabel.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOne of the main ingredients, maltodextrin, is a man-made polysaccharide popular as a food additive for its usefulness as a thickener and texturizer. Usually synthesized from corn or wheat, it has been added to food products since the 1950s and is now in something like 60% of all packaged foods. It also has some well-known effects on the microbiome^[See @nickerson_deregulation_2015], at least in mice, and on the ability of some bacteria to form biofilms. I couldn't find any studies in humans that specifically look at the affect on the microbiome, except now this Berkeley study.\n\nThe Soylent web site [explains that the maltodextrin](http://blog.soylent.com/post/68180382810/soylent-10-macronutrient-overview) is there to provide carbohydrates. Mixed with oat flour and other fibers to give it an overall lower glycemic index, it's naturally easy to digest and a quick source of energy. That sounds like a recipe that should significantly affect the microbiome, especially if you use it, as intended, as your main source of food. \n\n\nInterestingly, my gut diversity seems to have increased sharply right after drinking the Soylent, followed by a crash a few days later.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='myTests_cache/pdf/experimentSoylentDiversity_55842dcd2b0d21c4cc73e4f1967e6541'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Family-level diversity.

That said, it's not _that_ variable over time, and the few days after Soylent seem notably higher than the rest of the period measured. I'm betting this is really caused by the fact that I was visiting another city at the time, so the increase is likely related to travel more than the food itself. Still, something for future research to consider.\n\nFinally, let's look at the overall phyla-level breakdown.

The affect lasts a few days, and it's unusual compared to the rest of the sampling period, so I doubt it's a coincidence. Still, it's very hard to tell the cause.\n\nMore details are available on the [Mycrobes site](https://mycrobes.berkeley.edu/the-study/) of the student group that did the experiment. There is also a lively [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/76911u/an_interventional_soylent_diet_increases_the/).\n\n\n",

Fortunately he has _some_ Bifido, so I'm optimistic that with the right diet he may be able to increase his levels.  My sister, who complains of poor sleep too, has low Bifido as well, but again the good news is that it's not zero: she has something to work with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](CaseStudies_files/figure-pdf/caseFatherSonDiversity-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Alzheimers and the microbiome\n\n\n\"Anne\" is a 40-year-old mother with a secret: her 23andme genetic test results show she is homozygous for the APOE-4 variant, which in slightly-misleading-but-you-know-what-I-mean everyday language means she has the gene for Alzheimer’s disease. Statistics show that about 80% of people like her will develop the condition, and with this particular gene variant, it’s likely she may start to see early symptoms as soon as age 50. Scary! No wonder she doesn’t want anyone to know, including her children and relatives.\n\nBut Anne is also an optimist: she prefers to see herself as one of the 20% with the gene who *won’t* develop any symptoms. And she’s ready and motivated to do whatever necessary — diet, exercise, lifestyle changes — to beat this thing. She also knows that her body includes much more than human DNA, that for every human gene like that APOE-4 variant, she is host to as many as ten or a hundred times as many microbial genes, including — perhaps — some that with a bit of nurturing might help offset or prevent whatever propensity her human DNA has to this terrible disease.\n\nScientists researching Alzheimer’s disease have uncovered some intriguing relationships with the microbiome. (see [*this recent New York Times article*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/health/alzheimers-disease-infection.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=0) for a summary.) Some early AD symptoms, like a loss of smell, may be clues that the brain has been attacked by something that came from outside. The microbiome of the mouth, especially, is an excellent hiding place for low-grade infectious agents thanks to its many dark corners with regular access to both the inside and outside of the body^[See more here: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-microbiome-and-disease%3A-reviewing-the-links-the-Shoemark-Allen/89b2295bab63c6d9267dc29198cb829f452efb51?tab=citations ] \n. After reading about these relationships, Anne submitted several oral samples and shared the results with me.\n\nThe AD research field has blossomed lately with the realization that the brain, once thought to be completely sterile, is home to many microbes. This discovery and additional research has excited the editors of the respected *Journal of Alzheimers Disease,* who concluded a recent issue^[@itzhaki_microbes_2016 and here:https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad160152]:\n\n>We propose that infectious agents, including HSV1, _Chlamydia pneumonia_, and _spirochetes_, reach the CNS (Central Nervous System) and remain there in latent form. These agents can undergo reactivation in the brain during aging, as the immune system declines...The consequent neuronal damage... occurs recurrently, leading to (or acting as a cofactor for) progressive synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and ultimately Alzheimers Disease.\n\nThat’s a powerful indictment of specific microbes, and the article calls them out by name. So does Anne have any in her  sample?\n\nUnfortunately, here's where we see both the promise and the limitations of those of us who suspect the microbiome will play an important role in eventually conquering this terrible disease.\n\nThe promise is intriguing: if we could identify the specific microbes underlying the condition, and then, perhaps through antibiotics or probiotics or some other intervention, what if we could get rid of the \"bad\" microbes and reseed with the \"good\" ones?\n\nHere’s a high-level (phylum) look at Anne’s oral microbiome:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r}\n\\hline\n  & 1 & 2 & 3\\\\\n\\hline\nFirmicutes & 69.76 & 42.14 & 59.15\\\\\n\\hline\nBacteroidetes & 14.58 & 13.52 & 5.80\\\\\n\\hline\nVerrucomicrobia & 8.30 & 0.00 & 0.00\\\\\n\\hline\nEuryarchaeota & 7.52 & 0.00 & 0.00\\\\\n\\hline\nActinobacteria & 5.41 & 3.70 & 0.37\\\\\n\\hline\nProteobacteria & 1.94 & 36.47 & 28.63\\\\\n\\hline\nSynergistetes & 0.12 & 0.00 & 0.00\\\\\n\\hline\nFusobacteria & 0.01 & 4.20 & 1.08\\\\\n\\hline\nCandidatus Saccharibacteria & 0.00 & 0.08 & 5.07\\\\\n\\hline\nSpirochaetes & 0.00 & 0.01 & 0.02\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareful readers will immediately notice the Spirochaetes in those two later samples -- the same microbe identified as a suspect in the *Journal of Alzheimer's Research*. Is this just a coincidence?! Or have we found a link?\n\nAt this point, (big groan), we know there are quick-buck charlatans out there who will seize on an observation like this to sell hope to Alzheimer’s sufferers and their families: how about a new anti-Spirochetes supplement? A seven-step “detox” plan to permanently rid your system of Spirochetes? Great idea for a new business, or maybe a best-selling book, right?\n\nUnfortunately there are no shortcuts, and real conclusions from this data are still a ways away.\n\nIt turns out that Spirochetes is actually quite common in the oral microbiome. It’s a broad category of free-moving bacteria that like to hide in low-oxygen environments. Its most infamous members include the genus _Troponema_, associated with syphilis, which come to think of it is a disease that affects the brain. (In botany class they like to joke that it’s called Spirochaete because that’s what you get when you cheat).\n\nThe Spirochaetes in Anne’s test results are not _Troponema_, but even if they were it wouldn’t mean much. A lot of people have these. I have some in my own mouth microbiome. The ecology of the mouth is so rich and complex that it’s almost never possible to identify something as either “bad” or “good”.  Remember the example from earlier of “viridans” streptococci, the ones that beat back Strep Throat but can also cause heart problems?  \n\nThe same is likely to be true about whatever microbes might be involved with Alzheimer's. But the good news is that more sampling can play a role in helping to narrow down the microbes that are different in people who go on to develop the disease. If we can collect enough samples from people like Anne, who have a family history and are at high risk for AD, we can compare them to one another as well as to thousands of samples of people who are normal risk and maybe we’ll see a pattern.\n\nFor example, when Anne compared her mouth biome results with those from a close relative, she found that she has these unique phyla. The relative does not have them:\n\n             \n|  Anne's Unique Phyla   |   % diff   | \n|-----------------------------|-------| \n| Candidatus Saccharibacteria | 0.08% | \n| Spirochaetes                | 0.01% | \n| Tenericutes                 | 0.00% | \n\nInterestingly, this relative has none of her Spirochaetes. And we find two others missing as well. Do they matter? Who knows?\n\nThe microbiome studies that have been conducted so far on AD patients are too limited to offer suggestions for what Anne can do right now, but slight differences like this offer her some ideas for possible experiments in the meantime.\n\nAnne already follows the general advice that doctors give to everyone, including those at risk of AD, who wants a healthy microbiome: get plenty of exercise and sleep, eat healthy unprocessed foods, and avoid antibiotics. But, just possibly, there are variations on these general good habits that might help her today.\n\nFor example, she’s experimenting with different toothpastes to see how that affects her mouth microbiome. Did you know that most of the common toothpaste brands include powerful antibiotics?^[@pischel_triclosan_2014, available here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5781629/#!po=75.0000 ] Could the difference in brand be responsible for the unique phyla she sees? To learn more about herself, she’s experimenting with alternate brands -- testing her oral microbiome before and after to see the effects.\n\nThis is not the end of the story. Sadly we don't know what will ultimately happen to Anne. But through better knowledge of herself, and her microbiome, she's doing everything she can to beat the odds.\n\n\n\n## Colorectal Cancer {#caseStudyCancer}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul was a pretty normal father of two teenagers when he noticed something odd in the bathroom. At first he thought it was something he'd been eating; despite a lifetime of Southern living, he didn't have as much tolerance for deep-fried cooking as some of his neighbors and the past few weeks had been unusually heavy on the grease. So, he laid off the french fries for a few weeks and it seemed to get better. He had enjoyed a lifetime of perfect health: he was rarely sick, had never been inside a hospital except to visit others, and fully expected to live well into his 80s or 90s like his grandparents. \n\nHe wasn't worried, but a few months later his wife reminded him that his company insurance plan includes a free annual physical, and he thought why not. The doctor didn't seem worried either, but suggested a few more tests “just in case”, and unfortunately that's when he got the diagnosis that has been on his mind every day since: Stage IV colorectal cancer that has spread to his liver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you or a loved one find yourself in tragic situation like this, your first stop should always be with a medical professional. Paul's oncologist studied this full-time for years of medical school, has treated tens of thousands of cancer patients for 30 years, and gets paid to stay up-to-date on the latest science while interacting with other professionals like him. So it's beyond silly and arrogant -- not to mention dangerous -- to ask the opinion of an untrained amateur like me.\n\nBut still. Nobody, not even the most caring and selfless doctor, feels the urgency of the situation more than Paul and his family. They'll try anything; and who can blame them?  The same careful, methodical and well-informed approach that makes the mainstream medical profession more effective over the long term, well, maybe it also makes this doctor just slightly more risk averse. There are treatments that no responsible doctor would consider, but what exactly is a \"responsible\" treatment when you know that your odds are tragically small?  Seriously, what's there to lose?\n\n---\n\nIntriguing new discoveries have been made in the past few years about the relationship between cancer and the microbiome, and Paul asked if I know anything based on my years of near-daily sampling and amateur study. Might we find something in his microbiome, something that perhaps his doctor hasn't thought to consider? Given all that's known about microbiome-healthy diets, maybe if we found something unusual, some out-of-place microbe, is there a chance we might uncover a new, more effective treatment? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The culprit? [Courtesy of Dr. Allen-Vercoe, University of Guelph Katz Lab](https://www.flickr.com/photos/92803392@N02/9460876768)](CaseStudies/images/caseColorectalCancerFusobacterium.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany cancers seem to have a relationship with the microbiome. There are at least ten viruses which are known to be carcinogenic, including Human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes cervical cancer, and for which there is a vaccine. Some scientists guess that most cancers will eventually be shown to have their origins in a microbe, and although that's mostly speculation at this point, the idea of using microbes to treat or prevent cancer has attracted interest for more than 100 years.\n\n_Fusobacterium nucleatum_, _Bacteroides fragilis_, and many members of the large class of Enterobacteriaceae have well-studied characteristics that make them liable to cause the types of genetic damage that can give rise to cancer.\n\nI repeat: I'm not an expert -- I have no training or credentials in this at all -- so please don't take any of the following analysis as a substitute for the advice of a trained professional. Over the years, I've seen thousands of results from microbiome tests, including hundreds from people who claim to be healthy. We know for certain that Paul's chances are uncertain -- even with the best medical help in the world. Who can blame him for reaching out to anyone else who might have some insights?  The obvious place to start is to look at how Paul's microbiome sample may or may not differ from those healthy users.\n\n---\n\nOverall, I found his gut diversity is a little on the low side -- a Shannon value of 1.2. I'm usually somewhere between 2.0 and 2.5, though it's not uncommon to see lower, and [there's so much day-to-day variability](https://medium.com/microbiome/how-to-think-about-microbiome-diversity-9a39869137c1) in gut diversity that I wouldn't take a single result very seriously. \n\nNext I looked at the broadest, Phylum level, where I ranked all the microbes in comparison to the healthy samples, picking out the top ones that seem to be outliers. The following charts show the percentage abundance of Paul's top microbes (yellow dots), compared to the average (blue dot) and median (red) for my database of healthy people. The vertical lines show the range of abundances I've seen in healthy people, so a yellow dot above or below that line is an outlier that's worth considering further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Healthy ranges compared (Phylum).](CaseStudies_files/figure-pdf/experimentCCRCompareHealthyPhylum-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat high level of _Proteobacteria_ is a clue that something's not right. I've noticed that this microbe tends to be high in people with gut issues; _Kluyvera_, _E. Coli_, _Shigella_ and most common pathogens are in this group. Now, this is only one test, and it's not uncommon even in healthy people for the levels to show up high now and then.  In my daily sampling, I've often had several results that high, including one or two at 25% for no apparent reason. Still, maybe it's worth looking more closely, at the Order level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Healthy ranges compared (Order).](CaseStudies_files/figure-pdf/experimentCCRCompareHealthyOrder-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see way, way off-the-charts high levels of the order _Xanthomonadales_. These microbes take up 16% of his entire gut microbiome! Of the thousands of microbiome results I've studied, I see this bacterium from time to time, but never at such high abundances. Other than Paul, the most I've ever seen in my own gut came after returning from my 2-week camping trip in New Mexico, where my total was 0.0056^[I _did_ see a level of more than 30% in one of my _skin_ samples, again for no apparent reason (See [more analysis](#experimentSkin)).]. Paul's is 2800x that amount. \n\nNot sure what this means, but one version of that bacterium is a pathogen that lives in things like catheters; it's usually harmless and goes away when you take out the catheter. Is Paul's chemotherapy \"port\" involved? \n\nLet's look deeper, at the Genus level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Healthy ranges compared (Genus).](CaseStudies_files/figure-pdf/experimentCCRCompareHealthyGenus-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the one notable outlier is _Catenibacterium_. Intriguingly, the other people I've seen with such high levels are all unhealthy. One of them, like Paul, is undergoing chemotherapy. Is this a microbe that associates somehow with disease? And if so, is there anything he can (or should) do about it?\n\nKen Lassessen at https://cfsremission.com has compiled an extensive list of actions that can increase or reduce common microbes and [he finds evidence](https://cfsremission.com/2017/11/18/reducing-catenibacterium-genus/) that flaxseed oil is associated with reduced _Catenibacterium_. Is it worth trying? Ask your doctor.\n\nPeer reviewed studies of colorectal cancer and the microbiome have singled out _Fusobacterium_. In fact, that microbe is so clearly associated that [destroying it with the antibiotic metronidazole](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/11/20/science.aal5240) slows tumors in mice. There is none in Paul's sample, either because his current cancer treatments have eliminated it, or because it just wasn't detected in this sample. \n\nNew research shows that, at least in people with an inherited gene known to pre-dispose the likelihood of colorectal cancer, the gut microbiome can form a biofilm composed of slightly-mutated versions of two microbes: _Bacteroides fragilis_ and _Escherichia coli_.^[As reported in the [Feb 1 2018 edition of the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/health/colon-cancer-bacteria.html) based on research published in Science:  @dejea_patients_2018], neither of which is identifiable in Paul's sample.\n\nIf you found some in your microbiome sample results, would that that mean you are at risk? The short answer is no. For what it's worth, among the hundreds of samples people have sent me, _B. fragilis_ ranges between zero and 4% in healthy people, and zero to 7% in unhealthy people. Pretty inconclusive at best; misleading and counter-productive at worst.\n\nResearchers have found many other intriguing links between specific microbes and colorectal cancer, including a recent study hinting at an association with the *oral* microbiome: low abundance of _Lachnospiraceae_ in the gut apparently allows some oral pathogens to get a foothold in the gut mucosa.^[see \"Low colonic abundance of _Lachnospiraceae_ favours colonisation of gut mucosa by oral pathogens linked to CRC\" @flemer_oral_2017 ]\n\nAnother study (@jacouton_probiotic_2017) found that drug-induced colorectal cancer in mice could be prevented by feeding them a probiotic strain of _Lactobacillus casei BL23_. Although the research is unlikely to apply to humans, this particular strain is known to affect the immune system, producing a cascade of molecules that  appear to change a rat's response to cancer cells. For what it's worth, Paul's sample includes a bit of genus _Lactobacillus_ and some _Bifidobacterium_ too, though the test can't tell the particular strain.\n\nAre any of these microbial connections worth further investigation? Sadly, the chances are slim, but keep in mind that the best scientists on earth don't know the answers either. It's arrogant and patronizing to suggest that patients and their families should defer only to \"real\" scientists on these questions.\n\nWe need all the personal scientists we can get.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more references about the links between the microbiome and cancer, two good places to start are:  @garrett_cancer_2015 and @fulbright_microbiome_2017]\n\n\n\n\n## Ketogenic Diet {#caseStudyKeto}\n\nTHIS IS A VERY EARLY DRAFT\n\nWhat happens if you eat a very low-carb, high fat diet ?\n\nOne study finds higher levels of _Akkermansia_ and _Parabacteroides_ reduce production of gamma-glutamylation and modulate hippocampal GABA/glutamate ratios.^[@olson_gut_2018 ]\n\nHere is the microbiome of a person who tried Keto for several weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](CaseStudies_files/figure-pdf/plotKeto-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's compare two people.

Likewise, a 2017 study found elevated Akkermansia in individuals with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, which is considered a pre-motor symptom of PD (Heintz-Buschart et al., 2017). \n\nIs this observable in our samples?\n\n\"Patrick\" is a confirmed Parkinson's patient who sent me his microbiome test results.

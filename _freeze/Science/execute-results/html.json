And then, how do we apply what we know about the zillions of organisms _around_ us, to how they relate to what’s *inside* us?\n\nLike life itself, biology is a very broad field. Fortunately, despite the incredible variations, scientists have discovered a few simple traits and rules that apply to every life form. For the special life form _homo sapiens_, we have also learned a number of simplifications that will let us talk in more detail later.\n\n\n\n### The Basics\n\n\nThe study of biology starts with the cell, those tiny self-contained blocks that are the very definition of life. From the most humble microbe to the biggest animal, every living thing is made of these structures, which are really just miniature chemical reactors that pull external molecules from their environment and reassemble them in ways that perpetuate the reaction.\n\nEverything in the universe tends over time to fall into disorganized entropy, but cells contain many tricks, honed over billions of years of evolution, to thrive. Despite the diversity of life, a surprising number of those tricks are shared by all cells: a wall to protect and allow exchanges with the outside world, a means of storing information through DNA, and of course a process of reproduction.\n\nThe biggest technical difference among cells is not size or even function, but rather the distinction between two broad categories: eukaryotes, which are the cells of everything from corn plants to humans to fungi and amoebas, and prokaryotes, which are always single-celled bacteria and other microbes. It's interesting enough that all life could be characterized into these distinct groups, but if you look at the DNA that defines each cell, you will find some other odd differences that hint at more refined relationships among living things.\n\nA cell's DNA contains all the information needed to create another copy of itself; even the instructions for _how to do the copying_ are just a sequence of predictable DNA letters written somewhere in the genetic code of all cells. This very important copying function is performed by a *ribosome*, which is a complicated but well-studied part of every living thing. Because the ribosome has such a fundamental function, it tends not to fall prey to many mutations over time; after all, a single DNA letter change in the ribosome is almost always fatal to the entire cell. But every so often — maybe every few million years — there *is* a mutation in some part of the ribosome, and this leads us to a clever way to understand better how living things are related to one another.\n\nHumans and monkeys, for example, may differ in many different parts of their DNA, but their ribosomes are nearly identical. In fact, the ribosomes of all mammals and even all vertebrates are virtually the same. Well, there are some differences, but interestingly the differences between large, obvious groupings like vertebrates or invertebrates are much more significant than the differences between different vertebrates, or between mammals or other creatures.\n\nIn fact we can even quantify the differences, and scientists over the years have done exactly that. The ribosomes of humans and monkeys, for example, _are_ different in only 10 places — practically nothing in a molecule that consists of a few thousand nucleotides connecting dozens of proteins. Similarly, the ribosomes of vertebrates and invertebrates are different in perhaps 100 places -- clearly much more significant than the differences within each grouping, but still not terribly different relative to the entire ribosome.\n\nThe ribosomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, on the other hand, can be quite different: perhaps 1000 places (to continue this very-rough-but-sort-of-useful metric). The point is that even at the molecular, ribosome level, we can see obvious genetic differences even if the physical differences between two organisms aren't necessarily obvious at first glance. A one-celled eurkaryote, like an amoeba or algae, for example, might seem like it should share something in common with a one-celled prokaryote, but looks are entirely deceiving: nobody looking just at the ribosome could possible mistake these as similar.\n\nNow, scientists have mapped the differences in ribosomal structure among nearly all living things and this general rule always applies: the groupings of life forms are directly related to the similarities or differences in their ribosomes. \n\nMeanwhile, scientists have made estimates of how long it takes, given various assumptions, for a series of step-by-step mutations to result in a differently-sized ribosome. In other words, using some basic chemistry that is easily demonstrated experimentally in a lab, we can offer some reasonable guesses for the number of generations it would take for a given level of random mutations to result in the differently-sized ribosomes we see in nature. Add it all up, and behold: you can see a reasonable fit with the clues we have in the fossil record and the geological record for the same creatures.\n\nNone of this is perfect, of course, but the point is that we have a crude way to quantify how different one organism is from another and, if you like, we can guess how long it would take for a single common ancestor to accumulate enough random mutations to account for the differences between any two life forms.\n\nSo far so good. Next let's imagine we have a circle, where a single cell begins in the middle, divides into two cells, and those cells divide, etc. for zillions of years until there are clear ribosomal differences between each line. Let's call this a family tree and take all known life forms and spread them into this circle. \n\nIf you do that, you'll find that the number of mutations necessary to generate all the variation found in eukaryotes -- everything from corn plants to people -- would take up only a tiny sliver of that circle. The rest of life --- in particular the microbial life of prokaryotes -- is so unimaginably diverse, that a space alien looking at earth's lifeforms could well conclude that the differences between humans and corn plants aren't significant enough to worry about.\n\nThat's how complicated the world of bacteria can be.\n\n![Humans are only a tiny piece of the explosive variety of life.](/assets/images/assets/scienceTreeLife.jpg)\n\n### Taxonomy\n\n\nHow do you talk about the relationships between various different life forms?\n\nA taxon is a simple unit of life. A *homo sapiens* is a taxon, but so is a primate. A mammal is a taxon too. It might seem odd in the ordinary biological world to bother using the same term ‘taxon’ to refer to all of those units, but for bacteria and anything that reproduces asexually, it’s an important distinction because often, taxonomists don’t agree about whether a group of organisms is part of the same taxon or not.\n\nSince Carl Linnaeus in the 1700’s, the science of taxonomy divides all life into seven major categories: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (which I was taught in sixth grade to remember by the mnemonic “King Philip Came Over for Girl Scouts”).\n\nBacteria make up their own kingdom. Just as the animal kingdom includes everything from humans to jellyfish to beetles, the diversity of bacterial life is enormous, a point which can’t be emphasized too much. This is true at every rank in the taxonomy. Even two organisms that are the same at a lower rank, like genus, might have radically different affects on the human body, just as a member of the animal genus Canis could be anything from a wolf or coyote to a Chihuahua.\n\nYou cannot mix and match these ranks. If you know something about the number of organisms in one genus, for example, this is meaningful only in comparison to the numbers of another genus. Keep that in mind during our analysis.\n\n\n### Microbiology\n\nBefore we get to the nuts and bolts of analyzing the microbiome, it's helpful to review a few basics of microbiology.\n\nThis section explains more about cells, but now from a chemical point of view. It's through identifying these chemicals that we are able to understand how the entire system works. Chemists and biologists have developed many brilliant techniques for identifying these processes, nearly all of which take place at microscopic levels. How we are able to tell what's happening is a subject worthy of its own book, but here we will concern ourselves with understanding how we are able to convert the happenings in the physical world of the cell, to the software world, where we can do the analysis.\n\nA few questions to answer:\n\n- How do we see things at such a tiny scale? How can we be confident that what we see is real?\n- How does Next Generation Sequencing work?\n- What is a gene, how it creates proteins, and why that matters\n- what is a SNP?\n\nThink of cells as self-contained factories that accept tiny chemical raw materials from the outside, process them, and then output byproducts. There is a whole, well-developed chemical explanation for this which we won't detail, but this long chain of inputs and outputs, carried from cell to cell, is key to the working of every living thing, including humans. The various chemicals passed from cell to cell carry raw materials needed for life, but they also carry *information* that tells other cells what to do.\n\nAll life runs on three chemical building blocks: DNA, RNA, and proteins. Each of these is an arbitrarily-long chain of repeating molecules called *nucleotides* (DNA or RNA) and *amino acids* (proteins). Due to constraints on the way atoms interact, the set of building blocks is fixed. All DNA is composed of only four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, represented by the letters A, T, G, and C. RNA is composed of the same molecules, except that uracile (U) is substituted for thymine.\n\nSimilarly, proteins are constructed with only 20 different amino acids, which can again be represented by a short three-character abbreviation.\n\nThe correspondence between these different proteins and combinations of DNA or RNA is referred to as the genetic code.\n\nAs a programmer looking through all of this, you may immediately be inspired to write your own software version of this. After all, the remarkable consistency between all of these building blocks cries out for manipulation by computer.\n\nIn fact, that’s exactly what bioinformaticians do, and numerous software packages have been developed to make it easy to treat these building blocks of life like ordinary computer strings.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge is the volume of data to be handled, which can easily be measured in gigabytes for a simple organism, but can require entire server farms in the case of some real-world biological systems. For that reason, much of bioinformatics is about optimizations to improve the speed of processing a large data set, or to simply the presentation in a way that can reveal the most biologically interesting aspects of a problem without wading in over-complexity.\n\nOne special protein, DNA, can store information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving microbes are found everywhere on earth, often in surprising places. This section looks at some examples of how ubiquitous and hardy they can be, both in nature and on our bodies. We'll also discuss the technologies used to study the human microbiome.\n\n# Microbes Everywhere\n\nThe most important parts of our world are invisible. We can't see air, but we can't live without it. Similarly, our bodies are literally bathed in living, eating, reproducing lifeforms that we can't see but that have profound effects on all that we do.\n\nLife is tenacious, finding its niche, fighting for it, and stubbornly holding on in every environment it encounters. Living organisms inhabit the sky, deep underground, in the most barren habitats cold or hot anywhere on earth. The vast majority of these are microbes, so small we can't see them, but small doesn't mean irrelevant. In fact, the more that science understands about the invisible microbial world, the more it becomes clear that these uncountably numerous creatures exert a much bigger effect than we think.\n\nEvery traditional culture recognizes a role for the invisible, often translated with words like \"spirit\" or \"life force\", sometimes with more expressive terms like \"angels\", \"demons\", \"gods\" or even, simply, \"God\". It's tempting to dismiss these invisible forces as so much superstition, as though truth is made only of things we can see, but of course that's not quite true either. With the right instruments, we *can* see many invisible things; some of the greatest discoveries happen when a new gadget like a microscope or telescope makes people aware of a world that was previously hidden.\n\nThe invisible world of microbes is like that, with new, low-cost technologies showing us an incredible, rich, living universes of over 1 trillion species^[Nobody knows for sure, but perhaps the latest, best estimate is @locey_scaling_2016] waiting to be explored. \n\nThe word \"microbe\" refers to any tiny organism that carries its own genetic information for purposes of propagating itself. Far too small to see with the naked eye, dozens could fit inside a typical human cell. Although it's common to think of microbes synonymously with bacteria, in fact there are at least seven different types of microorganism:\n\n* bacteria\n* archaea: extremophile life forms that live and thrive in environments too challenging for bacteria\n* protozoa\n* algae \n* fungi\n* viruses\n* a few multi-cellular animal parasites such as helminths.\n\nEach of these has its own characteristic body type, means of reproduction, ways of moving around, and a deep, long history that is far older than humans.\n\nLet's look next at some of these environments and see the odd places where microbes have been found.\n\n\n## Microbes above and below\n\nScientists studying a water-filled fracture two miles underground at the Mponeng gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa, discovered _Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator_ by accident, after noticing odd levels of hydrogen compounds, by-products of the activity of an isolated bacterial colony.^[See @chivian_environmental_2008] Interestingly, this organism is a member of the same _Firmicutes_ phylum that dominates human guts, though this particular bacterium evolved quite separately from us: it hasn’t been exposed to surface water for millions of years. A systematic study of its genome revealed that, unlike other bacteria that usually live in co-dependent colonies, this one can survive all by itself, feeding on tiny bits of radioactive energy from uranium decay in an environment far removed from all other energy sources. It’s not a great life: these creatures reproduce rarely, only once every few hundred or thousand years. But at least they don’t have to worry about being consumed by predators down there.\n\nSubglacial Lake Whillans is a lake buried under more than 800 meters of ice in the West Antarctic. [A careful underground bore hole](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v512/n7514/full/nature13667.html) inserted by a team from Louisiana State University in 2014 found almost 4,000 different kinds of bacteria and archaea surviving under that ice.^[@the_wissard_science_team_microbial_2014] The total bacterial count was not that different from what you’d find in surface lakes on other parts of the planet, a fact that is especially surprising for an environment that hasn’t had a ray of light in millions of years. The bacteria instead thrive on iron, sulphur, and nitrogen as energy sources. ^[http://earthsky.org/earth/diverse-microbes-found-deep-beneath-antarctic-ice-sheet]\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Science_cache/html/fig-antarctic-image1_6c59df703ad70029ccf4a43f968c3b7e'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Go another 2,600 feet to find microbes. \nPhoto: [NASA/JPL-Caltech](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-077)](Science/assets/scienceMicrobesSky.jpg){#fig-antarctic-image1}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThose may not be the deepest examples. A Cold War-era Soviet team drilling the world’s deepest hole, were forced to abandon the project in 1994 at 12,261 meters (or 7.5 miles) underground, when they hit temperatures above 180 °C (or 356 °F), too hot for their equipment. Apparently the conditions weren’t too hot for life, though: the nine-inch diameter Kola Superdeep Borehole ^[http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kola-superdeep-borehole] found 24 species of fossilized plankton among the two-billion-year-old rocks down there. Of course, fossils are not the same thing as living microbes, but even dead remnants at that depth is evidence of the tenacity of life.\n\nCloser to the surface, [a 2015 Chinese study](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9159)^[@jing_links_2015 and a summary here: https://macroecology.ku.dk/media/news_list/2015/09_biodiversity-belowground-is-just-as-important-as-aboveground/] showed that 32% of the variety in an ecosystem is associated with variation in the life below ground, mostly bacteria that sustain the ability of roots to take nutrients out of the soil. Just knowing the temperature or precipitation levels of an environment won't tell you about the plants likely to be found there -- the microbes matter too.\n\nEven the sky contains living microbes. Scientists at the Institut de Chimie de Clermont-Ferrand in France have for decades sampled clouds to determine their precise contents, and sure enough: they find plenty of life there, usually between 1,000 and 10,000 bacterial cells per milliliter — not all that different from the amount [you’d find in alpine snow](http://www.livescience.com/26645-microbes-in-the-sky.html). Like every living organism, these cells must soak up water and other nutrients, converting them into energy and various by-products, which collectively have a massive effect on the overall atmosphere, more than enough to affect climate. ^[http://www.asmscience.org/content/journal/microbe/10.1128/microbe.7.119.1]\n\n::: {.cell hash='Science_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_3cac825c480a757c47f1c0d69560c9a1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Science/assets/scienceMicrobesSky.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nsource: [ASMScience](http://www.asmscience.org/content/journal/microbe/10.1128/microbe.7.119.1)\n\nThe upper atmosphere is a harsh place for life: regular freezing and thawing, constant bombardment of UV radiation from the sun during the day, cold, subzero freezing temperatures at night, high speed, unpredictable winds that quickly disperse any colonies. Plus, at any moment these organisms can find themselves flushed to the ground in a rainstorm, where they’ll need to adapt again.\n\nThese extreme conditions are just another day in the life for one species commonly found in clouds, _Pseudomonas syringae_, which harbors a protein in its cellular wall that reacts to cold temperatures, alternately preventing and allowing a water molecule to turn into ice and back. It doesn’t take many of these reactions to generate precipitation. With so many cells constantly floating in the atmosphere, even small changes in concentration — perhaps due to human activity on the ground — can, at least theoretically, make the difference between rainfall and drought. How much of an effect is hard to say: you can imagine how difficult it is to study bacteria floating in the sky.\n\nOur inability to access these environments is often the biggest reason we remain ignorant of the life that is found there, but there have been many attempts to learn more. Formal studies about the viability of microbes in space have been conducted since the early 1960s ^[@hotchin_survival_1967], when Apollo-era scientists wanted to understand the dangers of space travel, both to any humans in space as well as to those of us on the ground who might be exposed to any intersteller visitors.  \n\nAlthough new and bizarre extremophiles are discovered regularly, so far it appears that even the hardiest of known organisms have a tough time when directly exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation. But the particularly resilient spore-making _Bacillus subtilis_, for example, it is estimated could survive for at least six years if it were shielded somehow from direct sunlight, say embedded inside a meteorite.^[See an extensive 2010 review of everything known about space microbes in @horneck_space_2010.  Or skip to the [handy summary table](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832349/table/t3/) ]\n\nSeveral lichen species, including rock colonizing *Rhizocarpon geographicum* and *Xanthoria elegans*,  and the vagrant *Aspicilia fruticulosa*, remained alive after ten days of direct UV exposure on board a European Space Agency spacecraft. ^[@de_la_torre_survival_2010] Some especially hardy cyanobacteria that came with the lichens didn't survive, so perhaps  space offers a better chance for multicellular life, which has the luxury of outer protective pigmented layers.\n\n::: {.cell hash='Science_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_d75fd068ea0eae5e1ec6d322527807a5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Could be lichen outer space.

How did they get there! Who knows!\n\nWhat is known is that between a quarter and two-thirds of microbes in the air are entirely new and undiscovered organisms. A study of the “air microbiome” above New York City found bacteria and viruses that apparently originated in water, soil, vegetation, as well as in animals and humans, but even then few patterns emerge. Although there appear to be distinct microbial environments, on the land versus water, for example, overall many of these organisms are quite hardy and seem to find themselves migrating all over the place.\n\nThey can migrate in the smoke from a wildfire. A 2008 study by University of Idaho scientists^[@kobziar_pyroaerobiology_2018] identified a dozen microbes that are transported in plumes of smoke, despite temperatures of 250º C or more. The new science of *Pyroaerobiology* is uncovering many examples where smoke-transported microbes have an impact on forest health and more. \n\nStill other microbes thrive in radioactive environments, like the dangerous interior of a nuclear reactor. *Deinococcus radiodurans* is an extremophile member of Phylum Deinococcus-Thermus that boasts an impressive built-in DNA repair mechanism that lets it survive cold, vacuum, acid, light, dehydration – you name it. It remains unbothered by radiation levels more than 1,000 times higher than would kill a human.\n\nMicrobes seem capable of living off just about anything. _Ideonella sakaiensis_, discovered in 2016 by a Japanese team^[http://www.sci-news.com/biology/ideonella-sakaiensis-bacterium-can-break-down-metabolize-plastic-03693.html], can break down and metabolize plastic, just like the fungus *Aspergillus tubingensis*, found in 2018 in a garbage dump in Pakistan, which eats polyurethene in months rather than decades.^[ @khan_biodegradation_2017] The waxworm _Plodia interpunctella_, observed eating plastic in a lab probably owes its digestive abilities to other, as-yet-to-be-studied microbes.\n\nIn fact, many non-microbial organisms owe their most defining characteristics to microbes. Termites wood-eating abilities are thanks to a whole community of synergistic bacteria, archaea, and protists. Aphids can't live off sap without  _Buchnera_, a microbe that supplies them with essential amino acids.  Some microbes even play a role in the mineralization of copper and gold.^[@butof_synergistic_2018]\n\n\n\n<!--\n![Deinococcus radiodurans](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Deinococcus\\_radiodurans.jpg)\n-->\n\n::: {.cell hash='Science_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_69e3c6828ce094d3022c351c9486d71c'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Science/assets/scienceRadiodurans.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Microbes around you\n\nYou don't have to go to extreme conditions to find unusual microbes. Microbes thrive whereever humans live, and they are in our everyday environment too. The [PathoMap Project](http://www.pathomap.org/), studying DNA collected from the New York City area found that, like the air above, half of the microbes we walk past everyday are unknown to science. ^[@afshinnekoo_geospatial_2015] Most of the organisms are apparently benign, with no obvious affect on humans one way or another. Even when known pathogens are found, including *Yersinia pestis* (Bubonic plague) and *Bacillus anthracis* (anthrax), the lack of reported infections indicates that probably these organisms are busying themselves for some other, unknown, and maybe even useful purpose^[A later, more careful analysis indicates these particular pathogens may not actually be present: http://msystems.asm.org/content/msys/1/3/e00050-16.full.pdf]\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Science_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_ba27b87b754b47ba4f9a3b0d1e93f478'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Half of the organisms collected by the Pathomap study are unknown.

A station flooded by Hurricane Sandy showed a similarity to a marine environment a year after the disaster.\n\nHumans are the source of many unusual microbes in our environment. Regularly shedding 1.5 million skin cells per hour, your body's leftover inhabitants can colonize a hotel room in less than six hours.[^microbesaroundyou-3]\n\n[^microbesaroundyou-3]: http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-data-and-bacteria-mapping-the-new-york-subways-dna-1423159629\n\nYour household pets carry microbes, of course, but simply having a pet seems associated with different microbes in humans.

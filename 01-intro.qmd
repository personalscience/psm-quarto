# Getting Started {#Start}

To study your own microbiome, you'll first need to run your microbes through a gene sequencer. Finding precisely which bits of DNA, and which microbes, are in your body is a miracle of modern technology that requires state-of-the-art equipment in a high tech lab. Fortunately, the costs to you as a consumer are plummeting and it's now easy to have your microbiome tested for under $100.

What will you learn?

## Exercise {#caseStudyExercise}

I wanted to see if [this paper](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/8/792) is right in concluding that physically-fit women have lower _Eubacterium_. Here's one physically-fit woman I know and sure enough, she has none of this microbe.

Other people I've seen who _do_ have this seem to be either (1) older, or (2) on an unusual diet.

Here's a summary of the ranges I see in healthy people

```{r}

# summary(as.numeric(otu_table(people.healthy.gut.genus)["Eubacterium"]/10000))

as.numeric(otu_table(people.healthy.gut.genus)["Eubacterium"]/10000) %>% sort() %>%
  enframe(name = "user", value = "abundance") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=user,y=abundance)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Eubacterium in Healthy People", y = "Abundance (%)")

kable(mhg_abundance(subset_samples(people.norm, Username == "dr2"), "Eubacterium"))

# mhg_density_for_taxa(people.norm, "Eubacterium") +
#   annotate(
#   geom = "segment",
#   color = "blue",
#   x = as.numeric(otu_table(
#   subset_samples(people.norm, Username == "dr2")
#   )["Eubacterium"]) / 10000,
#   xend = as.numeric(otu_table(
#   subset_samples(people.norm, Username == "dr2")
#   )["Eubacterium"]) / 10000 ,
#   y = 0,
#   yend = 1
#   )

```

Although these people are all healthy, it's possible that those with _Eubacterium_ are more active than those without. That's an investigation for another day.

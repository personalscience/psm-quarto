## Microbes and health

The great French scientist Louis Pasteur, working as a physician in the 1800s, was the first to popularize the idea that the world is covered in *germs*, invisible agents that he associated with food spoilage and disease. Simple steps at hygiene (the word derives from a Greek phrase meaning "healthful art") could make conditions inhospitable for them, he discovered, enabling better food storage and dramatically fewer illnesses. Working as a chemistry professor in the 1850s, one of his students, the son of a local wine manufacturer, sought his help to solve problems with souring. Subsequent investigations led him to conclude that invisible yeasts were the culprit, and that exposure to air could affect the rate of fermentation. Pasteur's emphasis on controlling these microbes led to a general association of germs as pathogens, a bad, even evil force that we must destroy, every single time. The only good germ is a dead germ.

And for good reason. The development of effective disinfectants, and then antibiotics -- germ killers -- was one of the greatest medical achievements of all time, saving the lives of a significant fraction of the human race. Before Pasteur, urban life was a precarious game of chance against diseases that seemed to come and go randomly. Thanks to the development of the Germ Theory of Disease, it was suddenly possible to imagine a world where deadly illnesses and infections could be controlled and perhaps eliminated. Now, every day of your life, modern amenities like running water and flush toilets keep you healthy simply by controlling the growth of microbes.

Some can be quite nasty. The bacterium that causes Cholera, [*Vibrio cholerae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae), after infecting the small intestine, promptly hijacks the body's natural defense systems into sending a large stream of water through the colon to flush out all other bacteria. Normally, this would be an appropriate response to an invasion, but by hiding before the colon, *Vibrio cholerae* continues to breed above the main flow of water. The resulting diarrhea is so fierce that the patient is literally unable to drink enough to make up for the outflow, and dies of dehydration within days. And in a final act of cruelty, that water that the body pushes out so fiercely is itself full of *V. cholerae*, who use the opportunity to infect others who come in contact with the water.

Bacterial gastroenteritis -- more commonly known as "food poisoning" -- is a source of discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and worse for about 1.5 million Americans each year. Most of the time, it can be traced to *Campylobacter jejuni*, which has a shape and structure ideally suited to penetrating the mucosal layer of your intestines, where it attaches itself and begins to release toxins that activate the immune system and the resulting diarrhea and fever. *C. jejuni* is a natural and benign colonizer of the digestive tracts of many bird species, including poultry, and because most of the time these birds appear perfectly healthy, it's not uncommon for 20% or more of retail chickens to be contaminated. Fewer than 1,000 organisms under the right conditions can cause illness.

Fortunately, *C. jejuni* is easy to kill. Low pH, for example: 2.3 and they're dead (think lemon juice or vinegar). The antibiotic erythromycin is quite effective too, with almost no resistance observed so far. But the best weapon is heat: they strongly prefer the normal body temperature of birds (40$^\circ$ C or 105$^\circ$F ), and reproduce best at 42$^\circ$ (107.5$^\circ$F ). Go much higher than that and they'll slow down and die.

```

The toxins produced by the *Clostridium* genus are among the most dangerous. Botulism (C. *Botulinin*) Tetanus ( *C. tetani*), gangrene (*C. perfringens*), and of course C. *Dificile*.

Some bacteria simply use the darkness and wet warmth of the colon as a breeding ground, happily feasting on the materials they find there. They cause trouble not by what they eat, but by what they excrete: nasty toxins that mess up some other part of the body. *Clostridium botulinum* produces the neurotoxic protein botulinum that can weaken or freeze nerve cells. The most acutely lethal toxin known -- only 2 billionths of a gram can kill -- botulinum is almost as deadly to people as the plutonium in a nuclear bomb. Just a few pounds under the right conditions would kill everyone on earth.

Part of what makes pathogens so dangerous is it takes so few of them to be deadly. Some *Shigella* species, for example, become infectious with a starter colony of as few as ten organisms.[^microbes-and-health-1]

With such terrible killers lurking out there, it's tempting to divide all microbes into "bad" (pathogenic), "good" (probiotic) and "neutral" (commensal). You'll find plenty of lists that do just that.

But often, perhaps usually, the distinction between good and bad is unclear. Consider the "viridans" *Streptococci*, a group name for a whole breed of related microbes commonly found harmlessly in human mouths. If a few of these escape the mouth and somehow enter the bloodstream, they can land on a heart valve and can cause a dangerous, life-threatening infection. But inside the mouth they are tough competitors to other bacteria that may want a foothold, like the *Streptococcus* that causes Strep Throat. Mix Viridans with Strep A, and Viridans wins every time. So is it good or bad? Well, it's bad if your Viridans makes it to the heart; but in its regular form it protects you from other infections.[^microbes-and-health-2]

[^microbes-and-health-2]:  see page 119 @blaser_missing_2015

People with *Streptococcus lugdunensis* in their noses appear protected from some staph infections, probably because *S. Lugdunensis* produces a microbial antibiotic to kill off its competitors. But *S. lugdunensis* can itself cause skin infections.

Often it's the context that matters. *Staphylococcus aureus*, found in about a quarter of all Americans, is the agent behind a host of infections ranging from mild skin ailments to the deadly, often untreatable MRSA. But it seems to be harmless when in the presence of *Corynebacterium* species. [^microbes-and-health-3]

Fortunately, the body is pretty good at fighting off many pathogens. Around 94% of people who ingest *Salmonella* will recover without any medical attention at all.[^microbes-and-health-4] Sometimes the fight against bad bugs is helped by other bugs: *Lactobacillus* for example is especially good at crowding out pathogens.

[^microbes-and-health-4]: Of course, it's difficult to tell how many people *don't* go to the hospital; this is a risk estimate based on fairly generous assumptions about the amount of the pathogen in eggs and how many people eat them. @hope_overview_2002

### Food Allergies

If you attended elementary school before the 1980s, you can remember a time before nut allergies, when school lunches served peanut butter to everyone without the slightest worry that it might cause problems. Now many schools are forced to strictly limit the allowable kinds of food in their cafeterias, even from kids who bring their own lunches. Besides nuts, people suffer from allergies to milk, corn, eggs, fish, shellfish, soy, wheat, and many others.

Oddly, the very existence of food allergies appears to be an entirely modern problem. Medical journals didn't even mention food allergies until 1969, and examples were extremely rare before that. In fact, the very first mention of a food allergy happened about 100 years ago.[^microbes-and-health-5]. Human genetics hasn't changed suddenly in the past half-century, and given the variety of conditions, it seems unlikely that we can blame it on a single toxin or industrial pollutant.

[^microbes-and-health-5]: as mentioned in @spector_diet_2016 referring to Golbert, T.M., J Allergy (Aug 1969); 44(2): 96--107. *Systemic allergic reactions to ingested antigens* and Schloss, O., Arch Paed (1912); 29: 219. *A case of food allergy*

Several intriguing clues point in the direction of microbes as the cause of allergies. One theory, known as the "hygiene hypothesis", says that our modern environments are too sterile, that the immune systems of growing children need to be challenged by threatening invaders from time to time or they become overly sensitive. Now another idea, the "old friends" hypothesis suggests that it's not the hygienic conditions and lack of microbes *per se* that drive the autoimmune response, but rather it's that our bodies have evolved, over untold generations, to *expect* microbes in the environment, some nasty and some friendly, and when the developing immune system of a child is never exposed to these microbes, a breakdown occurs that misrecognizes certain foods as enemies instead.

Rutgers University scientist Martin Blaser [@blaser_missing_2015] thinks something odd has happened because of the overuse of antibiotics. There are plenty of people in Western societies who suffer far fewer food allergies, people like the Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania, who for centuries have kept to traditional ways of farming and who live in communities largely unaffected by industrialization. Their significantly greater time spent outdoors, challenged regularly by animal and soil microbial pathogens has made them far less likely to suffer from allergies than the rest of the population. Studies of Amish gut microbiomes show strikingly different profiles, generally with higher diversity and numerous microbes rarely found in urban people[^microbes-and-health-6].

[^microbes-and-health-6]: @zupancic_analysis_2012

Asthma, another terrible condition likely sparked by an incorrect balance between hygiene and microbes, points to better times ahead, its numbers of sufferers having peaked in the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, "We have probably seen the worst of the asthma epidemic"[^microbes-and-health-7] writes scientist Tim Spector, who suggests childhood asthma has been replaced by food allergies.

[^microbes-and-health-7]:  @spector_diet_2016

The good news is that, armed with our understanding of the relationship between microbes and allergies, new discoveries may offer treatments or even cures.

Evidence showing that *Clostridia* may counter sensitivity to peanuts [^microbes-and-health-8] has led to additional research behind the source of the problem. Now a new drug, Palforzia, is an FDA-approved treatment option for peanut allegies that works by exposing young children to small doses of the key microbe-stimulating compound in peanuts, letting immature immune systems develop a safer relationship with peanuts. Similar studies are underway for other allergies, lending hope that someday food allergies may once again fade into the background and disappear as they did 100 years ago.

[^microbes-and-health-8]: <http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/08/gut-microbe-stops-food-allergies>

Cathryn Nagler's lab has identified *Anaerostipes caccae* as a key microbe that protects against allergic reactions.[^microbes-and-health-9]

### Gluten

It's been well-established that a gluten free diet impacts the microbiome. This shouldn't be too surprising, given that gluten is a nutrient for some bacteria but not others. But what about people who show an unusual sensitivity, even allergy, to gluten? What's the cause?

Recently the idea of a gluten free diet has taken on fad diet status. Despite surprisingly little research evidence that it can quantitatively affect health, millions of people swear that gluten gives them various ailments from poor digestion to brain fog. If you don't believe it, they'll say, try it yourself and see; and sure enough, many of those who go off gluten claim big health benefits. Eating is usually a zero-sum game: stop eating one thing (say, the gluten in wheat) and you'll end up eating more of something else (rice or corn). Is it the switch to a different diet --- and the anticipation of success that this brings --- that makes people feel better, or is there something really significant about gluten itself?

The experts say no, with one important exception. A tiny fraction of people *do* suffer from Celiac disease, a known disorder of the body's ability to handle gluten. There are well-established tests that can definitely tell whether you have Celiac disease or not, and although the vast majority of people test negative, those who are true Celiacs will immediately and obviously benefit from a gluten free diet. But what's driving the difference?

As usual, the genetic evidence isn't completely lock-tight. Although a third of the population have particular versions of the (DQ2 or DQ8) of a cellular receptor called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), only a tiny minority go on to develop serious gluten sensitivities. Some studies indicate gluten sensitivity arises at an early age, and that perhaps celiac disease can be prevented by exposing babies to gluten at just the right moment, but other studies say the opposite.[^microbes-and-health-10]

[^microbes-and-health-10]: @vriezinga_randomized_2014

These are all clues that the microbiome may be involved, and sure enough, many studies show a definite difference between healthy microbiomes and those with clinically-proven Celiac disease.[^microbes-and-health-11] But because Celiac sufferers tend to eat differently than non-sufferers, it can be hard to tell how much of the microbiome is a result of a different diet, and how much is due to the disorder.

[^microbes-and-health-11]: @de_palma_effects_2009

Another clue happens further up the digestive system. Spanish researchers looking at the small intestine found curiously similar microbiomes in both healthy and celiac patients. [^microbes-and-health-12]. The difference happened at the functional level of what those bacteria *do*, and not necessarily in just whether the microbe is present or absent. *Lactobacillus*, it turns out, is one of the best degraders of gluten[^microbes-and-health-13], but there are others: *Bacillus pumilus*, *Stenotrophomonas maltophilia*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Most interestingly, unlike *Lactobacillus*, some of these bacteria can do more than just digest the gluten: they appear to contain enzymes that transform the gluten --- pointing to the possibility that the enzymes produced by these microbes could be purified and used to eliminate traces of gluten from food products.

[^microbes-and-health-12]: @herran_gluten-degrading_2017

[^microbes-and-health-13]: @rizzello_highly_2007

So if Celiac disease is caused by a change in the way some microbes function, how did that change happen in the first place? One theory is that it's a virus. Researchers at the University of Chicago and University of Pittsburgh were able to supercharge the way mice react to gluten by infecting them with a reovirus that apparently changes something about the body's immune response in the presence of the gluten protein. [^microbes-and-health-14]

[^microbes-and-health-14]: <http://www.today.com/health/celiac-disease-may-be-caused-virus-new-study-finds-t110119>

Members of your household will have more similar microbiomes if there's a dog present.[^microbes-and-health-15]

[^microbes-and-health-15]: see @song_cohabiting_2013 or [open text](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628085/)

Humans are able to synthesize just 30 plant-digesting enzymes. Contrast that to the species *Bacteroidetes thetaiotaomicron* which can break down plant structures using over 260 different enzymes.[^microbes-and-health-16]

### Obesity

Obese and diabetic people are subject to more infections than healthy people, but interestingly it's not the body mass index that drives this, but rather the accompanying hyperglycemia.[^microbes-and-health-17]

### Other conditions

[Some people](https://lactobacto.com/sinusitis-treatment-summary/) claim you can treat migraine headaches, sinusitus, and other conditions by inserting *Lactobacillus*-containing Kimchi up the nostril. I've not tried it and can't vouch for it, but let me know if it works for you.

## Microbes around you

You don't have to go to extreme conditions to find unusual microbes. Microbes thrive whereever humans live, and they are in our everyday environment too. The [PathoMap Project](http://www.pathomap.org/), studying DNA collected from the New York City area found that, like the air above, half of the microbes we walk past everyday are unknown to science. ^[@afshinnekoo_geospatial_2015] Most of the organisms are apparently benign, with no obvious affect on humans one way or another. Even when known pathogens are found, including *Yersinia pestis* (Bubonic plague) and *Bacillus anthracis* (anthrax), the lack of reported infections indicates that probably these organisms are busying themselves for some other, unknown, and maybe even useful purpose^[A later, more careful analysis indicates these particular pathogens may not actually be present: http://msystems.asm.org/content/msys/1/3/e00050-16.full.pdf]

Generally the microbes seem content to exist patiently with no apparent affect on the environment. A station flooded by Hurricane Sandy showed a similarity to a marine environment a year after the disaster.

Humans are the source of many unusual microbes in our environment. Regularly shedding 1.5 million skin cells per hour, your body's leftover inhabitants can colonize a hotel room in less than six hours.[^microbesaroundyou-3]

Your household pets carry microbes, of course, but simply having a pet seems associated with different microbes in humans. One study showed that babies living in a household with pets have more *Clostridiaceae*, *Veillonella* (especially for dogs), *Peptostreptococcaceae* and *Coprococcus.* Cats in particular seemed associated with lower *Bifidobacterium* while dogs seemed to spell doom for *Eggerthella*.[^microbesaroundyou-4]

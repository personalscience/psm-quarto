## Diet Change {#experimentDietChange}

After a lifetime of enjoying a banana or two almost every day, a [microbiome test from DayTwo](https://medium.com/neodotlife/review-of-viome-f024423a3d3a) suggested that I stop eating them. It also said I stop eating most grains, and if I do, to eat them with fat. Generally the recommendations pointed toward me eating a more fat and fewer carbs.  So for three months (Dec - Feb) I switched my diet to more of a low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF), with a goal of getting to under 25% carbs and 50% fat. (Figure \@ref(fig:experimentDietChangeMacroBefore))

```

This was harder than it might seem. I think of myself as a typical ominivore on a reasonably-healthy American diet: no sugary drinks or fast food, plenty of vegetables, mostly home-cooked with minimal processing. Sure, I make exceptions now and then, but my generally good health and weight level mean I don't worry too much about what I eat. I thought skipping bread and rice would be enough, but I learned that carbs are _everywhere_.  To get under 25%, I'm allowed only 65g/day.  Just my morning latte is 15g. A single banana is 23g, and if you add one more apple (22g), I'm over my daily limit. You can easily add fat: a tablespoon of olive oil (13g) or a tablespoon of butter (11g) won't seem like much food, but it adds up quickly. The problem, I found, is that fatty foods also tend to fill me up, so I eat less. And as a percentage of my calories, that means I'm allowed even fewer carbohydrates.

But I persevered. I'm not going to claim I was perfect -- I'm doing this experiment for fun, not for serious scientific research -- so there were days when I indulged differently. Still, just making a conscious effort was enough to push my eating habits in the general direction of less carbs, more fat. And soon I began to notice some effects.

Three months into the new diet, I noticed my sleep had changed slightly: I seemed to be sleeping longer and feeling better, from an average of 25 minutes extra per night -- a 5% improvement.  (see Figure \@ref(fig:experimentDietSleepSummary)) Could this have a microbiome explanation?

```{r experimentDietSleepSummary, fig.cap = "My sleep duration apparently increased by about 5% after switching to the new diet."}
#knitr::include_graphics("./Experiments/assets/experimentDietSleepSummary.png")


# get rid of that first day in January, which is an outlier
df <- rikStats[-1,] %>% dplyr::filter(Date < "2018-03-01" &  Z>5) %>% 
  group_by(Week = cut(Date, "1 week")) %>% 
  mutate(MeanZ = mean(Z)) %>% select(Week, Date,MeanZ)


ggplot(df,aes(x=Date,y=MeanZ)) + geom_line(stat="identity") + 
  ggtitle("Sleep Times (Weekly Average)") + 
  geom_rect(data=data.frame(xmin=5000, xmax=10000, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf),
            aes(xmin=lchf.dates[1], xmax=tail(lchf.dates,1), ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf),
            fill="red",
            alpha=0.2,
            inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
  annotate("text",x=lchf.dates[1]+length(lchf.dates)/2,y=7.5,label = "LCHF Diet") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))

```

To find out, I compared four gut microbiome samples taken _after_ starting the new diet with four taken before. (Table \@ref(tab:experimentDietChangeFTable))

```{r experimentDietChangeSetup, fig.cap = "Genus level differences before and after a change of diet."}

lowcarb.ssr <- c(426265, 445237, 463678, 459907, 459904, 463681, 463684)
lowcarbcontrol.ssr <- c(353903, 372807, 372921, 372987, 354959, 354977, 378011, 377310, 377238, 377996, 378005)

# genus level analysis here, on just the samples from the above SSRs
lowcarb <- subset_samples(sprague.genus.norm, SSR %in% lowcarb.ssr )
lowcarbcontrol <- subset_samples(sprague.genus.norm, SSR %in% lowcarbcontrol.ssr )
sample_data(lowcarbcontrol)$Label <- "Regular"

# The control group is about 5 months worth of "regular" samples, in this case a total of 72 gut samples
# taken (mostly) daily
lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut <- subset_samples(sprague.phylum.norm, (Site == "gut" | Site == "smartgut") & ((SSR %in% lowcarbcontrol.ssr) |
                                              (Date >"2017-06-01" & Date < "2017-11-01")))



mhg_plot_top_heat(subset_samples(merge_phyloseq(lowcarb,lowcarbcontrol),Site=="gut" | Site =="smartgut")) + ggtitle("Regular vs. Low Carb (Gut/Genus)")
```

```{r experimentDietChangeFTable}

lowcarb.phylum.gut <- subset_samples(sprague.phylum.norm, SSR %in% lowcarb.ssr & (Date > "2017-11-07" &
                  (Site=="gut" | Site =="smartgut")))

# Change the label names to anonymize the samples
sample_data(lowcarb.phylum.gut )$Label <- "LCHF"
sample_data(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut)$Label <- "Regular"
  

#mhg_plot_top_heat(subset_samples(merge_phyloseq(lowcarb.phylum.gut,subset_samples(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut, SSR %in% lowcarbcontrol.ssr)),Site=="gut" | Site =="smartgut")) + ggtitle("Regular vs. Low Carb (Gut/Genus)")

knitr::kable(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut %>% subset_samples(SSR %in% lowcarbcontrol.ssr) %>%
  merge_phyloseq(lowcarb.phylum.gut) %>% 
  mhg_abundance(colnames="Label",top=5)/10000,
  digits = 2, caption = "Phylum level abundances before and after a change to a low carb, high fat diet.")


#sample_data(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut %>% subset_samples(SSR %in% lowcarbcontrol.ssr) %>%
# merge_phyloseq(lowcarb.phylum.gut))[,c("Date","Site","Label","Notes")]


# I generated a phylum-level heatmap, didn't find anything, so then I perused this list
# list of 4 samples taken after the diet change.  Odd that all Firmicutes seem lower than my previous ones
#knitr::kable(mhg_abundance(lowcarb.phylum.gut,colnames="Label",top=10)/10000,digits=2)





```

Note the  substantial difference in the level of _Firmicutes _(Table \@ref(tab:experimentDietChangeFTable)). All of the LCHF samples seem to have _Firmicutes_ just slightly over 50%, whereas three of the four "Regular" samples are much higher.  Is that a coincidence? Is it statistically significant? 

To find out, I looked at all my gut samples from the previous six months, when I was on my "regular" diet, a total of 72 samples. The average (mean) abundance of _Firmicutes_ in those samples is shown in Table \@ref(tab:experimentDietChangeTableMean), plus the output of a simple T-Test that shows the likelihood that the difference could be due to chance alone.

```{r experimentDietChangeTableMean, fig.show = "hold"}
f <- mhg_taxa(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut,"Firmicutes") %>% select(abundance)
#mean(as.numeric(f$abundance)/10000)

ft<-otu_table(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut)["Firmicutes",]
f.ssr<-colnames(otu_table(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut)["Firmicutes",])

# create a new column for the labcarbcontrol samples: Firmicutes abundance
sample_data(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut)$Firmicutes <- as.numeric(otu_table(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut)["Firmicutes",])
#sample_data(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut)[,c("Date","SSR","Firmicutes")]

#sample_data(subset_samples(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut, SSR %in% colnames(ft[,as.numeric(ft)<500000])))[,c("Date","Label")]

# How to identify only those samples with under 50% Firmicutes
#otu_table(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut)[,otu_table(lowcarbcontrol.phylum.gut)["Firmicutes",]<500000]

ff <- mhg_taxa(subset_samples(lowcarb.phylum.gut, SSR %in% lowcarb.ssr),"Firmicutes") %>% select(abundance)
#mean(as.numeric(ff$abundance)/10000)

knitr::kable(data.frame(Regular = mean(as.numeric(f$abundance)/10000), LCHF = mean(as.numeric(ff$abundance)/10000)),
             col.names = c("Regular (Ave)","LCHS"),
             caption = "Mean Abundance of Regular Samples Compared to Low Carb/High Fat", digits = 2)

t.test(f$abundance,ff$abundance)

```

The extremely low p-value (`r t.test(f$abundance,ff$abundance)$p.value`) implies that the difference in sleep is unlikely to be due to chance. P-values have [serious problems](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005) as a way to measure whether something is statistically significant, but as a sniff-test, in this case the value is so low that it's worth investigating further.


```{r experimentDietChangeT, fig.cap = "T-Test summary of the statistical significances of differing Firmicutes abundance before and after a diet change (control n = 72, control = 4)"}
#t.test(f$abundance,ff$abundance)


```

Incidentally, among those Regular samples there were a few with under 50% _Firmicutes_ abundance, but were easily explained: for example, three of them happened after my [Soylent experiment](#experimentSoylent).

Conclusion: A low-carb high fat diet can affect _Firmicutes_ abundance.

---

What about _after_ my diet. Did things bounce back to normal? Although I'm more conscious of what I eat, and _do_ generally try to eat fewer carbs (e.g. I've stopped all banana eating), I wouldn't say I keep to the diet as rigorously as I did. But here are the results from the tests I took after finishing the experiment:

```{r}
feb.gut.phylum <- subset_samples(gut.phylum.norm, Date > "2018-02-01") #SSR %in% c(476724,476703))
mf <- mhg_abundance(feb.gut.phylum, top = 10)/10000

knitr::kable(mf[order(colnames(mf))], digits=2)
```

## Other foods and my microbiome {#experimentFood}

Food affects the microbiome, but can we tell more about which types of food and the specific microbes they affect?

I carefully tracked precisely which foods I ate and computed the totals for the main macronutrients. How do the abundance levels of a typical microbe change in response?

```{r experimentfoodComputeNutrient, fig.cap="See the interactive version of this chart: https://personalscience.shinyapps.io/shinyactinodb/"}
d <- tbl_df(mhg_taxa(gut.norm, "Bifidobacterium") %>% filter(date > "2017-06-01" & date < "2017-06-30"))
names(d) <- c("Date","Abundance")

f1 <- tbl_df(rikfood %>% filter(Date > "2017-06-01" & Date < "2017-06-30"))

f <- f1 %>% group_by(Date) %>% summarise(Fiber=sum(Fibre),Sugar= sum(Sugars), Carbs = sum(Carbs), Fat = sum(Fat))  %>% left_join(d)


ggplot(data = f %>% gather(Food, Value, Fiber, Sugar, Fat, Carbs), aes(x=Date, y = Abundance/40000)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Value/40, color = Food)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title="Bifidobacterium", y="%") +  
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*40, name = "Grams"))
```


Hard to see any particular patterns, but keep in mind that some foods take longer to digest than others. The abundance levels might be difficult to spot unless we did a carefully controlled experiment involving only a single type of food.

Instead of the macronutrients, maybe we can learn something by looking at a specific food.  Flax is often described as a powerful food source for gut bacteria. Can we tell which microbes are most affected, and by how much?

By tracking daily, I'm able to see trends and relationships that wouldn't show up in a normal large trial.

I occasionally eat ground flax seed, a few tablespoons mixed into other foods. How does it affect my microbiome compared to the days when I _don't_ eat it?


```{r experimentFlaxSetup, fig.cap = "Red dots mark days when I add flax."}

flax_day <- mhg_food_days(rikfood,"flax")
#flax_day <- mhg_food_days(rikfood,"beer|wine|ale|whiskey|pinot|chardonnay|cabernet|merlot|leinenkugels|pilsner|ipa")
flax_nextday <-flax_day+1

flax_df <- data.frame(flax = factor("no flax"),
                      date = as.Date(seq.Date(range(rikfood$Date)[1],range(rikfood$Date)[2],by=1)) )

levels(flax_df$flax) <- factor(c("no flax","flax","flax day two"))

flax_df[!is.na(match(flax_df$date,flax_day)),]$flax <- "flax" # days where I ate flax
flax_df[!is.na(match(flax_df$date,flax_nextday)),]$flax <- "flax day two"

#flax_df holds the dates on which I either ate "no flax", "flax", or it was the day after "flax day two"


```



```{r experimentFlaxDaysChart, fig.cap = "Red dots mark days when I ate flax."}
# flax days are spread throughout the period, not clustered over a single sub-period
#ggplot(data = flax_df, aes(x=date,y=flax, fill=flax)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
  

```



```{r experimentFlax, fig.cap = "Red dots mark days when I add flax."}

ps.flax <- subset_samples(gut.norm.nodupes,Date %in% (flax_df %>% filter(flax=="flax"))$date)
ps.flax <- prune_taxa(taxa_sums(ps.flax)>500,ps.flax)
ps.flax_nextday <- subset_samples(gut.norm.nodupes,Date %in% (flax_df %>% filter(flax=="flax day two"))$date)
ps.flax_nextday <- prune_taxa(taxa_sums(ps.flax_nextday)>500,ps.flax_nextday)

ps.noflax <- subset_samples(gut.norm.nodupes, Date %in% (flax_df %>% filter(flax=="no flax"))$date)
ps.noflax <- prune_taxa(taxa_sums(ps.noflax)>500,ps.noflax)
flax.df <- mhg_range_for(ps.flax)
noflax.df <- mhg_range_for(ps.noflax)
flaxNext.df <- mhg_range_for(ps.flax_nextday)

flaxDiff <- full_join(flax.df,noflax.df, by = "taxa") %>% select(taxa,flax = mean.x,noflax = mean.y) %>%
  transmute(taxa,flax=flax/10000,noflax=noflax/10000) %>% transmute(taxa,noflax, flaxAdvantage=flax-noflax) %>%
  arrange(desc(flaxAdvantage)) %>% na.omit()

flaxDiff1 <- full_join(flaxDiff,flaxNext.df, by = "taxa") %>%
  select(taxa,flaxAdvantage, noflax, flax1_mean = mean) %>%
  transmute(taxa,flaxAdvantage,flax1_mean = flax1_mean/10000 - noflax, sum = flaxAdvantage+flax1_mean)



flaxDiff2 <- flaxDiff1 %>% gather(day,diff_means,flax1_mean,flaxAdvantage) %>% na.omit() %>% arrange(taxa) 
flaxDiff2$taxa <- factor(flaxDiff2$taxa)
flaxDiff2$day[flaxDiff2$day=="flax1_mean"]<-"day of"
flaxDiff2$day[flaxDiff2$day=="flaxAdvantage"]<-"day after"
flaxDiff2$day <- factor(flaxDiff2$day)


ggplot(data=flaxDiff2 %>% filter(abs(diff_means)>0.05), aes(x=reorder(taxa,-sum), y = diff_means, fill=day)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
  labs(title = paste0("Genus microbes associated with eating flax"," (n=",
                      length((flax_df %>% filter(flax=="flax"))$flax), ")"),
       x = "Taxa (genus)",
       y = "Difference in mean abundance (%)")


```


```{r experimentFoodCorrelations }

# flax.df %>% head()
#  # %>% select(abundance)
# cor(mhg_taxa(ps.noflax, "Akkermansia")$abundance/10000,mhg_taxa(ps.flax, "Akkermansia")$abundance/10000)
# cat(mhg_taxa(ps.flax_nextday, "Akkermansia")$abundance/10000)
```

Notice how in nearly every case, flax-eating appears to affect microbiome abundances on both the day of the sample _as well as_ the day following. This makes intuitive sense: if flax has an effect, you'd expect it to linger for a day or two. If there were no effect, you might expect the levels to come and go randomly.

# ggplot(data=flaxDiff1 %>% filter(abs(flaxAdvantage)>0.05), aes(x=reorder(taxa,-flaxAdvantage), y = flaxAdvantage)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +

#   labs(title = "Genus microbes associated with eating flax",
#        x = "Taxa (genus)",

#%>% arrange(flax - noflax) %>% gather(control,value,flax, noflax)

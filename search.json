    "text": "Healthy people are all alike; every unhealthy person is unhealthy in their own way.\n– Leo Tolstoy (sort of) Anna Karenina.\n\n\n\nHow healthy are you?\nThis simple question is surprisingly difficult to answer quantitatively. Maybe you feel healthy, but is that enough? To really understand your health, you’ll need some context: How do you feel compared to … yesterday? a few years ago? How about compared to your close friends or family, or to an athlete or health expert you admire?\nA quantitative answer requires a systematic approach that integrates data collection, experiments, hypotheses, and iteration – tools that are familiar to any scientist.\n\nScience is curiosity, a genuine and humble search for truth using a never-ending process of systematic experimentation. It’s open to everyone and can be applied to any situation, including situations that affect you right now. It’s Personal Science when you use the scientific method to discover important insights about the wellness and performance of yourself and those around you.\nThis book will introduce you to one exciting area of personal science: understanding your own microbiome. It’s based on my own experiences collecting and studying hundreds of my own samples, and thousands from other people."

    "text": "Most of the examples in this book are based on over 600 near-daily samples I took of my own microbiome over a three year period. Inspired by an experiment conducted at MIT4, during most of that time I also carefully tracked the food I ate, my sleep, and other variables like activity and location. Most of my near-daily samples were of my gut, but I also regularly tested my skin, nose, and mouth. Since I’m generally healthy, I didn’t have a specific goal in mind other than to try to understand better what these microbes are doing, so many of my tests were taken while undergoing simple experiments, like eating a specific type of food or traveling to a new place. While not necessarily up to the rigorous standards of a formal scientific trial, these “n of 1” studies on myself helped me discover several new interesting facts about my own microbiome, many of which appear to contradict other published studies. In addition, hundreds of people sent me their own test results, letting me compare many different microbiomes. And of course, I also followed the latest developments in scientific publications and the general press as I eagerly tried to learn more.\nThis book tells you what I learned – and how you can learn too.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid, Lawrence A., Arne C.

    "text": "Although the techniques of science are useful in all aspects of life, many people are attracted to Personal Science out of concern over a personal health issue.\nMost of us grow up believing in experts. Whether it’s a proclamation from the government, a highly-regarded book, a credentialed doctor, or an experienced family member, it only makes sense to rely on others who have spent more time with the situation than you have, or who have gained a reputation for reliably solving similar problems.\nBut what happens when experts disagree? Of course, you can simply choose to believe one or another based on some reasonable criteria, like their track record with treating problems like yours.\nUnfortunately, many people find themselves suffering from a chronic condition for which expert advice seems to fail. One doctor says “do this” and another says the exact opposite. One treatment seems to work for while and then it no longer does. Sometimes the symptoms seem to disappear at random, despite undergoing no treatment at all. Five doctors give six different suggestions."

    "text": "3.1 How to Begin\nIf you suffer from a chronic condition, one of your first struggles is simply how bad is it? What is the precise version or name of this disease? What makes you different from a healthy person, or from the healthy person you used to be? Are there other people with the same condition, and if so, how does your situation compare to theirs? Are you getting better or worse?\nIn other words, you want to know the context. The first step in any treatment plan requires that you understand how you compare…to healthy people, to those who have the same condition as you do, to people who have partially or fully recovered. Are you improving or deteriorating?\nEven symptom tracking is just one aspect of the question of context. I want to know more precisely the conditions under which my problem gets better or worse. In other words, what is the context? (e.g. are my migraines triggered by high altitudes, by caffeine, by stress, by something else? All of these are just other ways of saying “context”).\nOne simple example: what’s the best way to treat a headache? There’s no good answer to that question unless you understand something about the context surrounding the person involved. The appropriate response will depend on whether he or she:\n\ngets headaches all the time.\nrarely gets headaches.\ndrank heavily the night before.\nrecently ate raw seafood from a street vendor.\nUnderwent a course of antibiotics for a tick bite last summer and seemed to get better until now.\n\nWe know intuitively that each medical situation depends on the circumstances. Doctors are helpful partly because they’ve seen so many other cases that they can quickly focus attention on the aspects that are important to a specific individual. In other words, doctors are trained to recognize the full context, to see how this situation compares to others."

    "section": "3.2 Reference Values",
    "text": "3.2 Reference Values\nMuch of our understanding of context is driven by reference values. A doctor knows whether your cholesterol is high or low based on large population studies of other people. Every health study is essentially just a way to calculate reference values: of the n people exposed to this treatment, some fraction will improve. If that fraction is large enough, we say the treatment works. If not, the treatment doesn’t work.\nSo the real question in any medical condition is: what is the reference value? What is the standard by which I am judging my current condition?\nFor many (most) situations, the reference values have been pre-computed based the medical community’s long experience treating patients like you. We know that X% of people with your type of cancer respond well to this drug. We know that Y% of people who smoke develop this disease. And on and on.\nBut for some situations – like data from microbiome tests – there is no reference value. Nobody knows what a “healthy” microbiome looks like. We need more data before we can say definitively that such-and-such abundance levels are “healthy” or “unhealthy”.\nIn other cases, there are reference values for the general population, but not necessarily for you. The average height of a 3-year-old girl, for example, is based on data from umpteen thousands of 3-year-olds, but what about among 3-year-olds of your ethnic group, or your family, or people of your socio-economic class, or those in your neighborhood? Whether to consider your 3-year-old for special treatment depends entirely on which reference group you are using.\nHow can we get those reference values?\nIn other cases, a treatment may be too new, or too crazy, for there to be reference values. A terminal cancer patient who tries an experimental treatment, for example, is living in a world of unknown reference values. Importantly, after they try the treatment, they become one of the reference values. And that’s great! we now have a reference value for that treatment — but only if somebody bothers to record it. Often that data simply falls on the floor with nobody to catch it."

    "text": "3.3 Quantifying the anecdotal\nIf the results of a treatment are not recorded, we still have reference values. People still rely on word of mouth — anecdotes — when looking for new treatments. But those reference values are anecdotal. You regularly hear stories of the form “I tried X and it worked for me”. Hear enough of those stories and you may want to try it yourself. But how many of those stories constitutes “enough” to try for yourself?\nWhat if there were a common way for everyone who tries X to record their results quantitatively?\nThat’s the idea behind symptom tracking, and it’s a nice start. Some companies try to add fancy additional features on top, like using machine learning to try to guess better than you can alone about the various correlations found within your data. Many companies go this direction — gather enough data, either from yourself or from others, so that we can predict the causes for various states. Again, that’s interesting and it’s a nice start, but it’s limited.\nWhat you really want — and the key, original idea behind Personal Science — is to let you take that quantitative data and compare it to others: others like you, people who you consider to be just like you except for such-and-such symptom.\nNow, in some cases, a symptom tracking or quantified self product will let you see yourself compared to an aggregated summary of all other users. Fitbit might let you compare yourself to all those of your sex or age, for example, or maybe those in your geography. This is a good start.\nBut what if you could choose your own subset of users with whom you want to compare yourself? Because only you know which type of person you identify with, or to which type of health condition you want to belong, Personal Science lets you analyze and study the data as a whole.\nThat’s why it’s personal – it’s about the one, unique data point that is you – and why it’s science – democratize the quantitative tools of science to let you understand your condition, for yourself."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Living microbes are found everywhere on earth, often in surprising places. This section looks at some examples of how ubiquitous and hardy they can be, both in nature and on our bodies. We’ll also discuss the technologies used to study the human microbiome.\nThe most important parts of our world are invisible. We can’t see air, but we can’t live without it. Similarly, our bodies are literally bathed in living, eating, reproducing lifeforms that we can’t see but that have profound effects on all that we do.\nLife is tenacious, finding its niche, fighting for it, and stubbornly holding on in every environment it encounters. Living organisms inhabit the sky, deep underground, in the most barren habitats cold or hot anywhere on earth. The vast majority of these are microbes, so small we can’t see them, but small doesn’t mean irrelevant. In fact, the more that science understands about the invisible microbial world, the more it becomes clear that these uncountably numerous creatures exert a much bigger effect than we think.\nEvery traditional culture recognizes a role for the invisible, often translated with words like “spirit” or “life force”, sometimes with more expressive terms like “angels”, “demons”, “gods” or even, simply, “God”. It’s tempting to dismiss these invisible forces as so much superstition, as though truth is made only of things we can see, but of course that’s not quite true either. With the right instruments, we can see many invisible things; some of the greatest discoveries happen when a new gadget like a microscope or telescope makes people aware of a world that was previously hidden.\nThe invisible world of microbes is like that, with new, low-cost technologies showing us an incredible, rich, living universes of over 1 trillion species1 waiting to be explored.\nThe word “microbe” refers to any tiny organism that carries its own genetic information for purposes of propagating itself. Far too small to see with the naked eye, dozens could fit inside a typical human cell. Although it’s common to think of microbes synonymously with bacteria, in fact there are at least seven different types of microorganism:\nEach of these has its own characteristic body type, means of reproduction, ways of moving around, and a deep, long history that is far older than humans.\nLet’s look next at some of these environments and see the odd places where microbes have been found."

    "section": "4.1 Microbes above and below",
    "text": "4.1 Microbes above and below\nScientists studying a water-filled fracture two miles underground at the Mponeng gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa, discovered Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator by accident, after noticing odd levels of hydrogen compounds, by-products of the activity of an isolated bacterial colony.2 Interestingly, this organism is a member of the same Firmicutes phylum that dominates human guts, though this particular bacterium evolved quite separately from us: it hasn’t been exposed to surface water for millions of years. A systematic study of its genome revealed that, unlike other bacteria that usually live in co-dependent colonies, this one can survive all by itself, feeding on tiny bits of radioactive energy from uranium decay in an environment far removed from all other energy sources. It’s not a great life: these creatures reproduce rarely, only once every few hundred or thousand years. But at least they don’t have to worry about being consumed by predators down there.\nSubglacial Lake Whillans is a lake buried under more than 800 meters of ice in the West Antarctic. A careful underground bore hole inserted by a team from Louisiana State University in 2014 found almost 4,000 different kinds of bacteria and archaea surviving under that ice.3 The total bacterial count was not that different from what you’d find in surface lakes on other parts of the planet, a fact that is especially surprising for an environment that hasn’t had a ray of light in millions of years. The bacteria instead thrive on iron, sulphur, and nitrogen as energy sources. 4\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Go another 2,600 feet to find microbes. Photo: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n\n\n\nThose may not be the deepest examples. A Cold War-era Soviet team drilling the world’s deepest hole, were forced to abandon the project in 1994 at 12,261 meters (or 7.5 miles) underground, when they hit temperatures above 180 °C (or 356 °F), too hot for their equipment. Apparently the conditions weren’t too hot for life, though: the nine-inch diameter Kola Superdeep Borehole 5 found 24 species of fossilized plankton among the two-billion-year-old rocks down there. Of course, fossils are not the same thing as living microbes, but even dead remnants at that depth is evidence of the tenacity of life.\nCloser to the surface, a 2015 Chinese study6 showed that 32% of the variety in an ecosystem is associated with variation in the life below ground, mostly bacteria that sustain the ability of roots to take nutrients out of the soil. Just knowing the temperature or precipitation levels of an environment won’t tell you about the plants likely to be found there – the microbes matter too.\nEven the sky contains living microbes. Scientists at the Institut de Chimie de Clermont-Ferrand in France have for decades sampled clouds to determine their precise contents, and sure enough: they find plenty of life there, usually between 1,000 and 10,000 bacterial cells per milliliter — not all that different from the amount you’d find in alpine snow. Like every living organism, these cells must soak up water and other nutrients, converting them into energy and various by-products, which collectively have a massive effect on the overall atmosphere, more than enough to affect climate. 7\n\n\n\n\n\nsource: ASMScience\nThe upper atmosphere is a harsh place for life: regular freezing and thawing, constant bombardment of UV radiation from the sun during the day, cold, subzero freezing temperatures at night, high speed, unpredictable winds that quickly disperse any colonies. Plus, at any moment these organisms can find themselves flushed to the ground in a rainstorm, where they’ll need to adapt again.\nThese extreme conditions are just another day in the life for one species commonly found in clouds, Pseudomonas syringae, which harbors a protein in its cellular wall that reacts to cold temperatures, alternately preventing and allowing a water molecule to turn into ice and back. It doesn’t take many of these reactions to generate precipitation. With so many cells constantly floating in the atmosphere, even small changes in concentration — perhaps due to human activity on the ground — can, at least theoretically, make the difference between rainfall and drought. How much of an effect is hard to say: you can imagine how difficult it is to study bacteria floating in the sky.\nOur inability to access these environments is often the biggest reason we remain ignorant of the life that is found there, but there have been many attempts to learn more. Formal studies about the viability of microbes in space have been conducted since the early 1960s 8, when Apollo-era scientists wanted to understand the dangers of space travel, both to any humans in space as well as to those of us on the ground who might be exposed to any intersteller visitors.\nAlthough new and bizarre extremophiles are discovered regularly, so far it appears that even the hardiest of known organisms have a tough time when directly exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation. But the particularly resilient spore-making Bacillus subtilis, for example, it is estimated could survive for at least six years if it were shielded somehow from direct sunlight, say embedded inside a meteorite.9\nSeveral lichen species, including rock colonizing Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, and the vagrant Aspicilia fruticulosa, remained alive after ten days of direct UV exposure on board a European Space Agency spacecraft. 10 Some especially hardy cyanobacteria that came with the lichens didn’t survive, so perhaps space offers a better chance for multicellular life, which has the luxury of outer protective pigmented layers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCould be lichen outer space. Photo: J Brew\n\n\n\n\nTraces of sea plankton, for example, have been found in space, on the surface of the International Space Station, where they are believed to have floated from the upper atmosphere. 11 Why?! How did they get there! Who knows!\nWhat is known is that between a quarter and two-thirds of microbes in the air are entirely new and undiscovered organisms. A study of the “air microbiome” above New York City found bacteria and viruses that apparently originated in water, soil, vegetation, as well as in animals and humans, but even then few patterns emerge. Although there appear to be distinct microbial environments, on the land versus water, for example, overall many of these organisms are quite hardy and seem to find themselves migrating all over the place.\nStill other microbes thrive in radioactive environments, like the dangerous interior of a nuclear reactor. Deinococcus radiodurans is an extremophile member of Phylum Deinococcus-Thermus that boasts an impressive built-in DNA repair mechanism that lets it survive cold, vacuum, acid, light, dehydration – you name it. It remains unbothered by radiation levels more than 1,000 times higher than would kill a human.\nMicrobes seem capable of living off just about anything. Ideonella sakaiensis, discovered in 2016 by a Japanese team12, can break down and metabolize plastic, just like the fungus Aspergillus tubingensis, found in 2018 in a garbage dump in Pakistan, which eats polyurethene in months rather than decades.13 The waxworm Plodia interpunctella, observed eating plastic in a lab probably owes its digestive abilities to other, as-yet-to-be-studied microbes.\nIn fact, many non-microbial organisms owe their most defining characteristics to microbes. Termites wood-eating abilities are thanks to a whole community of synergistic bacteria, archaea, and protists. Aphids can’t live off sap without Buchnera, a microbe that supplies them with essential amino acids. Some microbes even play a role in the mineralization of copper and gold.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Microbes around you\nYou don’t have to go to extreme conditions to find unusual microbes. Microbes thrive whereever humans live, and they are in our everyday environment too. The PathoMap Project, studying DNA collected from the New York City area found that, like the air above, half of the microbes we walk past everyday are unknown to science. 15 Most of the organisms are apparently benign, with no obvious affect on humans one way or another. Even when known pathogens are found, including Yersinia pestis (Bubonic plague) and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), the lack of reported infections indicates that probably these organisms are busying themselves for some other, unknown, and maybe even useful purpose16\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf of the organisms collected by the Pathomap study are unknown. Source: Afshinnekoo et al. (2015)\n\n\n\n\nGenerally the microbes seem content to exist patiently with no apparent affect on the environment. A station flooded by Hurricane Sandy showed a similarity to a marine environment a year after the disaster.\nHumans are the source of many unusual microbes in our environment. Regularly shedding 1.5 million skin cells per hour, your body’s leftover inhabitants can colonize a hotel room in less than six hours.17\nYour household pets carry microbes, of course, but simply having a pet seems associated with different microbes in humans. One study showed that babies living in a household with pets have more Clostridiaceae, Veillonella (especially for dogs), Peptostreptococcaceae and Coprococcus. Cats in particular seemed associated with lower Bifidobacterium while dogs seemed to spell doom for Eggerthella.18\n\n\n\n\nAfshinnekoo, Ebrahim, Cem Meydan, Shanin Chowdhury, Dyala Jaroudi, Collin Boyer, Nick Bernstein, Julia M.

Wearable devices like FitBit or Apple Watch, or a nutrition or dieting app like MyFitnessPal, can help optimize some aspects of your physical body but hard work and discipline will take you only so far. As you reach the limits of how much you can change, you’ll settle into the discovery that the genetic component is undeniable. Over one million customers of the genetic testing company 23andme have opted to look at their genes in part to understand better what their own limits are.\nGenes do seem important. Everything from twin studies to laboratory experiments with knock-out mice shows that large parts — perhaps the major part — of our health and even behaviors are determined as much by our genetic makeup as by the environment in which we put ourselves.\nStill, despite much progress since the unveiling of the Human Genome Project in 2001, there are frustratingly few examples of genes that decisively determine one trait or another. Except for a few simple cases like eye or hair color, most genes seem merely to increase or decrease the odds one way or another. When you read the details about your own genes, you’ll be disappointed at how little about genetic testing is truly insightful. Did you really need a DNA test to tell you that you are lactose intolerant?\nWorse, even when the science tells you something you didn’t know — your likelihood of Alzheimers or Grave’s disease — there often isn’t much you can do about it besides eat healthy and get plenty of exercise. In fact, with disappointingly few exceptions, nearly all conclusions you’ll get with DNA results will be advice you should be doing anyway.\nWhat’s an optimizer to do? On the one hand, the evidence is powerful that genes determine much or most of your health, but on the other hand, you can’t do much about it beyond the obvious. The results of human DNA testing just aren’t all that actionable.\nFortunately, one of the most exciting consequences of the latest science on human genetics is the role played by other genes in your body. And the best news: you can change them! And you don’t need a fancy laboratory with complicated equipment for recombinant DNA. This book will show you how, through experiments on the types of food you eat and deliberate changes you can make in your environment, you can make a significant difference in kinds and functions of the genes inside you."

Who am I, if only 1% of the genes inside me are human? The answer is microbes, and as befits something that so outnumbers the “human” part of us, they play a large role in everything about what we do, from our health to our moods and even to our motivations. To put this more precisely, humans have 20,000 - 25,000 genes, but just the microbes in your intestines alone have an estimated 2 to 4 million genes.\nThese microbes and the important DNA they carry are constantly changing, sometimes quite significantly, depending on what you eat, who you’re with, and a host of other factors that you can manipulate."

But that’s what we would think, wouldn’t we? In fact, the microbes are everywhere, literally everywhere on earth, in the sky, even deep underground. We can’t go anywhere without encountering microbes because, well, there are even microbes on and inside us. Humans can’t survive without microbes. So what does it even mean to say we’re “better” or more “advanced” than they are?\nBefore the microscope, people didn’t even know that microbes existed. Similarly, until the advent of large-scale gene sequencing machines in the past ten years, almost nothing was known about the amazing ubiquity and resilience of microbes. Yes, they’re single-celled and yes many of their cellular functions seem more straightforward than the functions of a multi-cellular creature like us, but it would be a mistake to assume that means microbes – collectively – are less influential, and certainly it would be a big error to assume they are less important. Fact is, these organisms have been around, breathing, eating, multiplying, for billions of years, often in pretty much the same form that they are today. These things have survived every imaginable planetary condition from volcanoes to the depths of the ocean to the inside of nuclear reactors. Global Warming means nothing to these guys, who have seen and thrived all over the earth since the day life first appeared."

    "text": "5.4 What they want\nBecause they have such a huge advantage over us, in lifespan (each microbe is an exact divided copy of itself, going back a zillion generations), in speed of replication (they can double in just a few minutes under the right conditions), and ubiquity (as I said, cellwise they far outnumber us), they can afford to colonize every new imaginable environment.\nAnd that’s what they do, every time a new frontier opens to them. The moment of your birth, for example, when you left the (mostly) sterile conditions of your mother’s womb, they immediately flooded all over your skin, mostly coming from your mother, and in that fresh environment they used their first-mover advantage to get a stronghold that in many cases lasts your entire life. Many (most?) of the microbes that matter arrived inside you this way, originally, and many of them are still there today, decades, even half a century or more later.\nTo survive, they need one thing: something to eat. Being so tiny, they don’t need much, and they mostly eat things that you (and other larger creatures) weren’t interested in anyway. (Or, since they were here first, it’s probably more accurate to say that you and I must live on the foods that they don’t want. A cheeseburger is only food for you because you snatch it faster than they do. Leave it outside for a while and they’ll get it eventually)."

    "text": "5.5 Who’s in charge?\nCollectively, the multitude species of microbes will eat just about everything, but individually each species has its preferences. When they’re outside the body, as I said, they can “colonize” new territories (like fresh baby skin) to get what they want, but those inside your tummy are at the mercy of whatever it is you decide to put into your mouth.\nOften, that’s not a big deal: many species thrive on the same proteins, carbohydrates, and fats that you do. But some species do better than others with certain types of foods, and this is where the line between your human desires and theirs becomes unclear.\nEighty percent of all your brain’s outside receptors – counting all the nerve endings everywhere on your skin – eighty percent complete their connections in the gut. The main switching grounds, an area called the vagus nerve, does something. What? We know very little, but we see some evidence that the purpose – the reason that not 1% or 10% or 50% but a full 80% of all the receptors go to the gut – is so the microbes can tell your brain what to do.\nWhen you find yourself feeling hungry, ask yourself who is feeling hungry. Scientists have traced that feeling of hunger to changes in certain hormones like leptin, but wait – why did the leptin levels change in the first place? Could it be that a microbe someplace was manipulating your leptin levels, perhaps by poking that vagus nerve just the right way – to get your brain to start thinking about whatever food that microbe wants?\nThis isn’t as ridiculous as it sounds, the idea that microbes could influence your feelings and desires. Think about a disease like the rabies. Because it spreads through saliva, it can’t find new territory unless its host somehow finds itself exchanging saliva – biting – another potential host. So guess what a rabies victim can’t stop thinking about? Biting a new victim. The microbe literally puts a thought into the mind.\nThere are many other examples, so many in fact as to be potentially a bit disturbing when we realize that we humans may be much more at the mercy of tiny microbes than we think. Links have been made between microbes and schizophrenia, stress, anxiety, self-grooming, and much more. Autism Spectral Disorders, which have always seemed puzzling because of the relationship they seem to have with digestive problems, are also linked to microbes, or the lack thereof.\nPerhaps the most intriguing example is the common parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the strange organism that can only reproduce in the intestines of cats. A parasite seen often in all warm-blooded mammals, it’s found in about a third of the global population of humans too. It’s one of the reasons they tell pregnant women to stay away from cat litter. But here’s the interesting part: when a Toxo protozoa infects a mouse, it leaves cysts in the mouse brain that make it attracted to cat urine! Yes, it changes the neurology of a mouse so that it’s more likely to end up inside a cat’s tummy – exactly where it can reproduce.\nThink about this too much, and you’ll end up with the obvious question: what other weird microbes are infecting us right now? Can we explain some of our own behaviors this way? Is there a human equivalent of these infections, driving us to do things we “ordinarily” wouldn’t do? And maybe these microbes are so ubiquitous, teeming all over us and in our brains, maybe there’s no way to even know what “ordinary” or “normal” human behavior is."

    "text": "5.6 What is health?\nModern, western medicine tends to think reductively about health, dividing the body into pieces like organs and cells and prescribing interventions that target one particular aspect of the whole, with specific drugs or supplements. But of course nothing as complex as the body and health can be simplified this much. Maybe you can’t really think about human hardware without thinking about the whole ecology that goes with it, the various organisms live in and around us and greatly outnumber us.\nFrom this perspective, the whole idea of “health” takes on a new meaning, because we’re no longer talking about the status of a single organism – me – but rather about the entire functioning ecosystem of many, many living things, including the “me” that I want to refer to as a human. You can’t survive long without these microbes any more than you can survive without air. This whole “me”, sometimes referred to as the “holobiont”, is perhaps the true unit of what it means to be human and healthy.\nRedefining health in terms of the holobiont has important implications for treatment. If it’s the entire ecology in and around me, then targeting a single unit or a single symptom may not be the best solution. Treating a skin condition with an antimicrobial salve, for example, may inadvertently destroy other microbes necessary for some other function. Teeth-brushing or hair shampooing, while seemingly fundamental aspects of hygiene, may not be simply about “getting rid” of something that we think of as “bad”, such as an unwanted odor. In your zeal to rid yourself of one thing (the odor) you may be introducing another (a skin condition someplace else). It might be better to treat the root cause, figure out why the odor is there in the first place.\nBut what is a “root” cause in a complex ecological system like our bodies? After all, anything that affects one part of the body is likely to affect others as well. Is there a way to affect everything all at once?\nDiet is one way. What you eat is an input to the entire ecosystem.\nWhere you live – your environment – is another. From the air you breathe (is it clean? cold?) to the amount of stress you face, change your immediate surroundings and you will change the ecosystem.\nIf we no longer think of our bodies as independent parts, then our treatment options must be holistic. No intervention should be done without considering the consequences it has on the whole. Similarly, it may often (usually?) be true that the best treatments are dietary or environmental – facing the entire holobiont at once."

    "text": "The great French scientist Louis Pasteur, working as a physician in the 1800s, was the first to popularize the idea that the world is covered in germs, invisible agents that he associated with food spoilage and disease. Simple steps at hygiene (the word derives from a Greek phrase meaning “healthful art”) could make conditions inhospitable for them, he discovered, enabling better food storage and dramatically fewer illnesses. Working as a chemistry professor in the 1850s, one of his students, the son of a local wine manufacturer, sought his help to solve problems with souring. Subsequent investigations led him to conclude that invisible yeasts were the culprit, and that exposure to air could affect the rate of fermentation. Pasteur’s emphasis on controlling these microbes led to a general association of germs as pathogens, a bad, even evil force that we must destroy, every single time. The only good germ is a dead germ.\nAnd for good reason. The development of effective disinfectants, and then antibiotics – germ killers – was one of the greatest medical achievements of all time, saving the lives of a significant fraction of the human race. Before Pasteur, urban life was a precarious game of chance against diseases that seemed to come and go randomly. Thanks to the development of the Germ Theory of Disease, it was suddenly possible to imagine a world where deadly illnesses and infections could be controlled and perhaps eliminated. Now, every day of your life, modern amenities like running water and flush toilets keep you healthy simply by controlling the growth of microbes.\nSome can be quite nasty. The bacterium that causes Cholera, Vibrio cholerae, after infecting the small intestine, promptly hijacks the body’s natural defense systems into sending a large stream of water through the colon to flush out all other bacteria. Normally, this would be an appropriate response to an invasion, but by hiding before the colon, Vibrio cholerae continues to breed above the main flow of water. The resulting diarrhea is so fierce that the patient is literally unable to drink enough to make up for the outflow, and dies of dehydration within days. And in a final act of cruelty, that water that the body pushes out so fiercely is itself full of V. cholerae, who use the opportunity to infect others who come in contact with the water.\nBacterial gastroenteritis – more commonly known as “food poisoning” – is a source of discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and worse for about 1.5 million Americans each year. Most of the time, it can be traced to Campylobacter jejuni, which has a shape and structure ideally suited to penetrating the mucosal layer of your intestines, where it attaches itself and begins to release toxins that activate the immune system and the resulting diarrhea and fever. C. jejuni is a natural and benign colonizer of the digestive tracts of many bird species, including poultry, and because most of the time these birds appear perfectly healthy, it’s not uncommon for 20% or more of retail chickens to be contaminated. Fewer than 1,000 organisms under the right conditions can cause illness.\nFortunately, C. jejuni is easy to kill. Low pH, for example: 2.3 and they’re dead (think lemon juice or vinegar). The antibiotic erythromycin is quite effective too, with almost no resistance observed so far. But the best weapon is heat: they strongly prefer the normal body temperature of birds (40\\(^\\circ\\) C or 105\\(^\\circ\\)F ), and reproduce best at 42\\(^\\circ\\) (107.5\\(^\\circ\\)F ). Go much higher than that and they’ll slow down and die.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: How to kill common pathogens. Source: Myhrvold et al. (2011) p.145\n\n\n\n\nThe toxins produced by the Clostridium genus are among the most dangerous. Botulism (C. Botulinin) Tetanus ( C. tetani), gangrene (C. perfringens), and of course C. Dificile.\nSome bacteria simply use the darkness and wet warmth of the colon as a breeding ground, happily feasting on the materials they find there. They cause trouble not by what they eat, but by what they excrete: nasty toxins that mess up some other part of the body. Clostridium botulinum produces the neurotoxic protein botulinum that can weaken or freeze nerve cells. The most acutely lethal toxin known – only 2 billionths of a gram can kill – botulinum is almost as deadly to people as the plutonium in a nuclear bomb. Just a few pounds under the right conditions would kill everyone on earth.\nPart of what makes pathogens so dangerous is it takes so few of them to be deadly. Some Shigella species, for example, become infectious with a starter colony of as few as ten organisms.1\nWith such terrible killers lurking out there, it’s tempting to divide all microbes into “bad” (pathogenic), “good” (probiotic) and “neutral” (commensal). You’ll find plenty of lists that do just that.\nBut often, perhaps usually, the distinction between good and bad is unclear. Consider the “viridans” Streptococci, a group name for a whole breed of related microbes commonly found harmlessly in human mouths. If a few of these escape the mouth and somehow enter the bloodstream, they can land on a heart valve and can cause a dangerous, life-threatening infection. But inside the mouth they are tough competitors to other bacteria that may want a foothold, like the Streptococcus that causes Strep Throat. Mix Viridans with Strep A, and Viridans wins every time. So is it good or bad? Well, it’s bad if your Viridans makes it to the heart; but in its regular form it protects you from other infections.2\nPeople with Streptococcus lugdunensis in their noses appear protected from some staph infections, probably because S. Lugdunensis produces a microbial antibiotic to kill off its competitors. But S. lugdunensis can itself cause skin infections.\nOften it’s the context that matters. Staphylococcus aureus, found in about a quarter of all Americans, is the agent behind a host of infections ranging from mild skin ailments to the deadly, often untreatable MRSA. But it seems to be harmless when in the presence of Corynebacterium species. 3\nFortunately, the body is pretty good at fighting off many pathogens. Around 94% of people who ingest Salmonella will recover without any medical attention at all.4 Sometimes the fight against bad bugs is helped by other bugs: Lactobacillus for example is especially good at crowding out pathogens."

    "text": "6.2 Food Allergies\nIf you attended elementary school before the 1980s, you can remember a time before nut allergies, when school lunches served peanut butter to everyone without the slightest worry that it might cause problems. Now many schools are forced to strictly limit the allowable kinds of food in their cafeterias, even from kids who bring their own lunches. Besides nuts, people suffer from allergies to milk, corn, eggs, fish, shellfish, soy, wheat, and many others.\nOddly, the very existence of food allergies appears to be an entirely modern problem. Medical journals didn’t even mention food allergies until 1969, and examples were extremely rare before that. In fact, the very first mention of a food allergy happened about 100 years ago.5. Human genetics hasn’t changed suddenly in the past half-century, and given the variety of conditions, it seems unlikely that we can blame it on a single toxin or industrial pollutant.\nSeveral intriguing clues point in the direction of microbes as the cause of allergies. One theory, known as the “hygiene hypothesis”, says that our modern environments are too sterile, that the immune systems of growing children need to be challenged by threatening invaders from time to time or they become overly sensitive. Now another idea, the “old friends” hypothesis suggests that it’s not the hygienic conditions and lack of microbes per se that drive the autoimmune response, but rather it’s that our bodies have evolved, over untold generations, to expect microbes in the environment, some nasty and some friendly, and when the developing immune system of a child is never exposed to these microbes, a breakdown occurs that misrecognizes certain foods as enemies instead.\nRutgers University scientist Martin Blaser (Blaser 2015) thinks something odd has happened because of the overuse of antibiotics. There are plenty of people in Western societies who suffer far fewer food allergies, people like the Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania, who for centuries have kept to traditional ways of farming and who live in communities largely unaffected by industrialization. Their significantly greater time spent outdoors, challenged regularly by animal and soil microbial pathogens has made them far less likely to suffer from allergies than the rest of the population. Studies of Amish gut microbiomes show strikingly different profiles, generally with higher diversity and numerous microbes rarely found in urban people6.\nAsthma, another terrible condition likely sparked by an incorrect balance between hygiene and microbes, points to better times ahead, its numbers of sufferers having peaked in the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, “We have probably seen the worst of the asthma epidemic”7 writes scientist Tim Spector, who suggests childhood asthma has been replaced by food allergies.\nThe good news is that, armed with our understanding of the relationship between microbes and allergies, new discoveries may offer treatments or even cures.\nEvidence showing that Clostridia may counter sensitivity to peanuts 8 has led to additional research behind the source of the problem. Now a new drug, Palforzia, is an FDA-approved treatment option for peanut allegies that works by exposing young children to small doses of the key microbe-stimulating compound in peanuts, letting immature immune systems develop a safer relationship with peanuts. Similar studies are underway for other allergies, lending hope that someday food allergies may once again fade into the background and disappear as they did 100 years ago.\nCathryn Nagler’s lab has identified Anaerostipes caccae as a key microbe that protects against allergic reactions.9"

    "text": "6.3 Gluten\nIt’s been well-established that a gluten free diet impacts the microbiome. This shouldn’t be too surprising, given that gluten is a nutrient for some bacteria but not others. But what about people who show an unusual sensitivity, even allergy, to gluten? What’s the cause?\nRecently the idea of a gluten free diet has taken on fad diet status. Despite surprisingly little research evidence that it can quantitatively affect health, millions of people swear that gluten gives them various ailments from poor digestion to brain fog. If you don’t believe it, they’ll say, try it yourself and see; and sure enough, many of those who go off gluten claim big health benefits. Eating is usually a zero-sum game: stop eating one thing (say, the gluten in wheat) and you’ll end up eating more of something else (rice or corn). Is it the switch to a different diet — and the anticipation of success that this brings — that makes people feel better, or is there something really significant about gluten itself?\nThe experts say no, with one important exception. A tiny fraction of people do suffer from Celiac disease, a known disorder of the body’s ability to handle gluten. There are well-established tests that can definitely tell whether you have Celiac disease or not, and although the vast majority of people test negative, those who are true Celiacs will immediately and obviously benefit from a gluten free diet. But what’s driving the difference?\nAs usual, the genetic evidence isn’t completely lock-tight. Although a third of the population have particular versions of the (DQ2 or DQ8) of a cellular receptor called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), only a tiny minority go on to develop serious gluten sensitivities. Some studies indicate gluten sensitivity arises at an early age, and that perhaps celiac disease can be prevented by exposing babies to gluten at just the right moment, but other studies say the opposite.10\nThese are all clues that the microbiome may be involved, and sure enough, many studies show a definite difference between healthy microbiomes and those with clinically-proven Celiac disease.11 But because Celiac sufferers tend to eat differently than non-sufferers, it can be hard to tell how much of the microbiome is a result of a different diet, and how much is due to the disorder.\nAnother clue happens further up the digestive system. Spanish researchers looking at the small intestine found curiously similar microbiomes in both healthy and celiac patients. 12. The difference happened at the functional level of what those bacteria do, and not necessarily in just whether the microbe is present or absent. Lactobacillus, it turns out, is one of the best degraders of gluten13, but there are others: Bacillus pumilus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most interestingly, unlike Lactobacillus, some of these bacteria can do more than just digest the gluten: they appear to contain enzymes that transform the gluten — pointing to the possibility that the enzymes produced by these microbes could be purified and used to eliminate traces of gluten from food products.\nSo if Celiac disease is caused by a change in the way some microbes function, how did that change happen in the first place? One theory is that it’s a virus. Researchers at the University of Chicago and University of Pittsburgh were able to supercharge the way mice react to gluten by infecting them with a reovirus that apparently changes something about the body’s immune response in the presence of the gluten protein. 14\nMembers of your household will have more similar microbiomes if there’s a dog present.15\nHumans are able to synthesize just 30 plant-digesting enzymes. Contrast that to the species Bacteroidetes thetaiotaomicron which can break down plant structures using over 260 different enzymes.16"

    "text": "6.6 Diversity and health\nMost microbiome discussions begin with the assumption that diversity is good. Virtually any popular book or article about how to improve your health will suggest ways to increase diversity, usually by eating specific foods. For what it’s worth, a study of more than 10,000 gut microbiomes found only one sure-fire association with higher gut diversity: people who self-report eating more plants have higher diversity than those who eat fewer types of plants, and this is true no matter their diet type (omnivore, vegan).18\nThe intuition is easy to understand: if your body harbors a wide variety of microbes, you’ll have a deeper catalog of useful ones that can be applied to new situations. The world around us is constantly changing, and you never know what new threats or opportunities you may encounter. You can respond better if you have an abundant variety of organisms that can meet any challenge.\nIn practice, diversity is difficult to pin down quantitatively. We know what we mean in principle: having a variety of different microbes seems good, but clearly there are limits. You wouldn’t want “variety” to include serious pathogens, for example. We know intuitively that a deciduous forest at sea level, with dozens of differerent tree species, is more diverse than one at a high altitude tree line. But is the one at low altitudes “better”? It depends on where you live!\nA similar problem has long confronted ecologists, who have developed several diversity measures that have been adapted to the micro world:\n\nAlpha diversity: the variance within a particular sample. Usually measured as a single number from 0 (no diversity) to infinity, or sometimes as a percentile, this is what most of us mean when we look at our microbiome results and ask about diversity.\nBeta diversity: how samples vary against each other. Many scientific studies are interested in the differences between sites on the body, or microbiomes across geographic locations. Beta diversity is typically the thinking behind “clustering” algorithms that try to show differences or similarities among samples.\n\nAll diversity metrics take into account two aspects of a community: the number of different organisms in a sample, and the range of abundances for each one. To understand how this works, think of two forests, each with an equal number of trees. (Table 6.1)\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Diversity example: two forests with an equal number of trees, and one with fewer trees.\n\n\nForest\nNumber of Trees\nNumber of Species\nDiversity\n\n\n\n\nA\n1000\n1\nLow\n\n\nB\n1000\n1000\nHigh\n\n\nC\n10\n10\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly, Forest B with its abundance of species and trees is the most diverse. But what about Forest A compared to Forest C?\nOn the one hand, Forest C seems to have a greater variety of trees: 10 times more than Forest A. But it also has many fewer of them. In other words, there are two aspects of diversity that matter: the absolute number of organisms in an ecosystems, and the variety or richness of those that are there.\nWhether A is “better” or “worse” than C depends on subjective, non-quantifiable factors that are not included in any diversity metric. A managed forest, such as one on a Christmas tree farm, might be perfectly healthy for one purpose (growing Christmas trees for sale), while an adjacent clear-cut forest with ten lonely and scraggly trees could be far less healthy, even if it has more of a variety of trees.\nIn this example, we use the distinction richness to refer to Forests B, or C, with their greater variety of species, and the overall term diversity tries to be a measure of both richness and abundance.\nWe can apply the same principle to our taxonomy tables: A microbiome sample with 100 unique taxa is more diverse than one with only 10 unique taxa. But if we just use raw, absolute numbers, it can be hard to compare across different microbiome tests. For example, what if I have two samples, each with 100 unique taxa, but in one sample there are tiny amounts of all but one of the taxa, while the other sample has equal amounts of everything? Which is more diverse?\nOne way to quantify this is with a metric borrowed from probability theory. What if, instead of looking at all the taxa and their respective amounts, we simply take at random any two taxa from the sample: what is the probability that the two will be the same?\nIf I have a sample with 100 unique taxa, each of identical abundance, then the odds are pretty low that I would select at random two of the same taxa; conversely, if a majority of the sample consists of the same taxa, with many other taxa of smaller abundance, then the odds are pretty good that the two I select would be the same.\nIn fact this is generally the case in healthy western guts, which are usually composed of only two large phyla: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. In my case, as you’ll see, these two phyla make up over 90% of everything in my samples; the third most abundant taxa rarely breaks 10%. The odds that you would randomly pick these two is pretty high. That’s the intuition behind the Simpson metric, developed in 1949 by the British scientist E.H. Simpson.\nBut note that with Simpson, high numbers mean low diversity; after all, in a homogeneous sample with no diversity, the odds that you’ll pick the same taxa will be 100%. To keep this consistent with the idea that higher numbers mean more diversity, most scientific studies of the microbiome use Inverse Simpson, which is simply 1 divided by the Simpson number. Note that for very low Simpson numbers, the Inverse Simpson value can be quite high, even approaching infinity when dealing with a microbiome with many unique and extremely low abundance taxa.\nThe taxonomy of microbes matters too. Each successively lower taxonomical rank always has at least as many taxa as the higher levels, so you can’t simply count the total number of taxa at a rank. A single genus like Bifidobacterium, for example, can have dozens of species associated with it. For this reason, microbiologists usually measure diversity at the Family level: it’s a good compromise between overall coverage and specificity of taxa.\nIn the real world, the type and variety of microbes in the body are constantly changing, so it’s important not to get too hung up on a single number for a single sample. You’ll see this later when we look at how diversity changes in my own experiments\nThe key is to take multiple samples and not rely on a single day’s measure. If you take many samples over time, you’ll find that the moving average is much more stable, and a better overall indicator of diversity.\nThere are other measures of diversity as well. The Shannon Index borrows from Information Theory to ask how much unique information is contained in a given sample. A radio signal that broadcasts random static, for example, would have a lower Shannon number than one for a music concert. Similarly, a microbiome with a boring makeup – all the same species, for example – would have a lower Shannon number than one containing a rich abundance of many different types of microbes. In practice, Shannon and Inverse Simpson tend to track one another reasonably well, a clue that they are getting at a similar idea. (Figure 6.2))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Comparing two types of diversity.\n\n\n\n\nThat said, Shannon tends to fall within a narrower, more predictable range, so I prefer it over Inverse Simpson when looking at my own samples. It often doesn’t matter which metric you use, though, as long as you’re consistent.\nNevertheless, I have learned to not place much stock in any diversity measure. After all, whether diversity is “good” or “bad” depends on what is in the sample. Is high diversity good even if it includes many known pathogens? Is “low” diversity good if it only includes one or two known commensal bacteria? As always in the microbiome world, it’s hard to tell19\n\n\n\n\nBlaser, Martin J. 2015.

    "text": "8.1 The technology for studying microbes\nPeople have been farming the microbes in fermented foods for thousands of years, so when in Pasteur times, scientists first began to cultivate them for experiments, the most obvious way was through the process known as “culturing”. Take a sample containing some microbes of interest, and leave them sit in a hospitable environment long enough for them to reproduce in enough quantity to be useful. That’s still a common way to study microbes, and that couple-of-day incubation period is one reason you don’t get your lab tests back for a few days.\nCulturing also has several serious limitations. It only works if the microbes are still living, which rules out many important situations. Many microbes don’t culture well or at all outside their native habitat.\nAnaerobes are organisms that can’t survive in the presence of oxygen, not a problem deep inside the airless gut, but it won’t work in a normal lab. While you can take some precautions to preserve the original environment as much as possible – you can set the organisms in a specially-sealed oxygen-free container –the cost and expense rises quickly.\nEven if, somehow, you were able to overcome all the other challenges, many (perhaps most) microbes don’t grow well unless they are in close proximity to other specific species. Methanobrevibacter smithii, for example, which plays a critical role in the efficient digestion of complex sugars, removes hydrogen from its environment, providing a habitat for organisms that don’t like hydrogen, like Firmicutes and Bacterodetes. Plus, it converts all that excess hydrogen to methane, which in turn is needed by yet other organisms. Culturing any of those microbes on their own would be difficult, if not impossible.\nBut the techniques for uncovering which organisms are where and what they are doing was revolutionized in the first decade of the 2000s by those new-fangled gene sequencers that were so usefully applied to human genes.\n\n8.1.1 The 16S rRNA Gene\nDespite the plunging costs of DNA sequencing, the trillions of microbes in your gut still present a formidable chellenge if you intend to sequence them all. Even the humble E. coli contains nearly five million DNA letters. There is some commonality between related organisms — humans and chimpanzees, for example, share upwards of 90% of their DNA — but in general it’s hard to use the DNA strand itself to measure the relatedness between two organisms. Understanding the reason for this may help you understand why there is a clever shortcut.\nYou might think you can measure the relatedness of two organisms by looking at all the DNA in each one and computing the percentage that each shares in common. This would work, but sequencing all those billions of DNA bases takes a lot of time and money, and it would be impractical in a case like the microbiome where you may need to do this for millions of individual organisms.\nA service like 23andme is able to cheaply compare individuals of the same species (i.e. Humans) because the generic human genome is already well-mapped and we know that of the 3 billion base pairs, only about 3 million (the SNPs or single-nucleotide polymorphisms) are different between individuals. When you give your spit sample to 23andme, they give you back a subset of your SNPs, only those that have been studied enough to be interesting. SNPs are easy and cheap to find using a “gene-chip”, a special semiconductor-like device that can quickly look at 1 million or more pre-determined spots on your DNA. But this is only possible because the map itself already exists, thanks to multi-year effort of the Human Genome Project that finished in the early 2000s. There are no comprehensive gene chips (yet) for bacteria, and certainly not for all the millions of species in nature. And even if there were such chips, bacteria are notorious at adapting and changing to their surrounding environment, exchanging genes with one another, that it just wouldn’t be practical to identify enough constant genes to make it worthwhile.\nFortunately, to get an overall picture of the types of microbes in your body, we don’t have to sequence every piece of DNA. For our purposes, we just want to know which organisms are there, and in what abundance. The precise bits of DNA are important only if they let us know the names of the microbes, and for this we don’t need to bother sequencing everything. In fact, most bacterial species differ enough from each other that we need only a few bits of DNA from each in order to tell them apart.\nWe know that all bacteria are distantly related to one another, and that closely-related species will have more DNA in common with each other. But some of parts of DNA are so important that they stay virtually identical even across entire families of organisms. Remember that DNA describes absolutely everything about the organism, including the workings of very low-level cell process. Not just the size or shape, but much more fundamental: how a cell divides, for example, or even how to use the oxygen a cell needs for survival.\nAmong the most fundamental of all processes is what happens in every cell’s ribosome, a special molecule that is core to how a cell converts DNA into proteins. Because all cells create proteins, they also always contain a ribosome and, importantly, they contain the instructions for how to create a ribosome in the form of the ribosomal gene. Each cell’s DNA includes a gene that precisely encodes every protein, in the exact order that makes up the ribosomal structure. A special enzyme, called DNA polymerase, manufactures new bits of RNA on the fly as it hits portions of the DNA. These bits of RNA, called messenger RNA or mRNA, eventually make their way to ribosomes, which are floating throughout the cell. Upon hitting the ribosome, mRNA is converted into the proteins that make all life possible. If it happens that the mRNA hits upon a segment of DNA that encodes a gene for a ribosome, guess what new molecule is manufactured? A new ribosome!\nThis ribosomal gene is such a fundamental part of every living organism that very little about the ribosome changes, even after hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Humans and corn plants actually share quite a bit of the ribosome; both are prokaryotes, for one thing, so many of our cellular processes work the same. But bacteria go back even further than humans and corn plants, enough so that the differences aren’t so subtle anymore. In fact, the differences are big enough that, with clever selection of the part of the genome to sequence, you can tell the difference between two bacteria in a few hours for a fraction of the cost of running through all the DNA you might find in a microbiome.\nThe gene that encodes ribosomal RNA (written rRNA) for bacteria consists of about 1500 base pairs total, a tiny fraction of the entire genome, and although it is mostly identical across all bacteria, there are some differences, all of which are contained in nine “hypervariable” regions containing even fewer base pairs. These regions, named V1 through V9, are surrounded by strings of base pairs that are constant throughout all bacteria, and can be quickly discovered and amplified by the right DNA primers. The fourth one of these regions, V4, contains only 250 base pairs, and is quickly and easily sequenced on commercially-available sequencing machines.\nWhen you submit your sample to a lab, the bacterial cells must first be cut into pieces (“lysed”, to use the technical term). Sometimes the first part of this process happens at collection time, when you swab a tiny bit of your sample into a vial and stir. The vial contains tiny “beads” that smash into the cell walls as you stir, breaking them apart to spill their contents in an ugly liquid “goo”.\nThe lab is interested only in the DNA inside that goo, so they start by dropping in some carefully-constructed “primers”. These are bits of known, synthetically-made DNA that are designed to bind just to the parts of the cell DNA that make ribosomes. In particular, these primers will only find bits of DNA that make the specific, V4 subregion of the ribosome. Primers naturally bind and then break open the DNA at precise locations, cutting out all the segments that match.\nThrow this goo into a centrifuge spinning at a carefully controlled, very high speed, and different parts of the goo will rise to different levels, reflecting their molecular weights. One specific part, corresponding to the section programmed to make ribosomes, will rise to a centrifuge level referred to as “16S”. Precisely skimming the goo at that spot will give the technician a collection of DNA from just one part of the ribosome of bacteria. The rest of the DNA, millions of letters (base pairs) per bacteria, will not be sequenced and is simply discarded. That’s the shortcut. Instead of sequencing millions of base pairs, we need sequence only hundreds.\nOnce you have a bunch of that 16S ribosomal gene, you know that you are looking exclusively at non-human bacterial and archaeal DNA. It’s a tiny subset of all the genetic information in the microbiome, but combined with one more shortcut, it gives a surprisingly accurate look at the overall composition of a sample.\nThe remaining shortcut is possible thanks to years of research of sequencing the genes in bacteria. Scientists in labs around the world have been faithfully digging up samples of bacteria, and performing whole-gene sequencing on what they find. Although 250 base pairs may seem like a tiny number to differentiate among all possible bacteria on earth, for gut microbiome purpoes we need concern ourselves only with those that are known to inhabit humans. The Human Microbiome Project already identified most of these bacteria – and their 16S gene identifiers – so armed with that as a reference database1, it is generally possible to unmask a specific microbe with just a sliver of DNA.\nIt’s this two-step combination, 16S “skimming” and a database lookup, that makes it cost effective to study the millions of organisms in your microbiome. You don’t have to do a complete gene sequence on every single bacterium; just trust that the tiny subset of DNA in the 16S region is enough to uniquely match something already in the bacterial database.\nThe alternative – sequence everything in the sample – provides much more accuracy of course, but the 16S approach comes surprisingly close. Careful studies that compare with the “sequence everything” (aka metagenomic) approach show that 16S is still surprisingly close – at least 80% and often much more of the entire microbiome can be categorized accurately, even at the species level.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Just 253 base pairs of the V4 subregion are enough to correctly classify more than 80% of the species in a sample. (Source: Jackson Laboratory)\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1.1 Limitations of 16S\nWhile 80%+ accuracy for such a cheap and fast method of sequencing is impressive, it’s important to remember that we’re still not seeing the whole story. Despite its low cost and wide use, microbiome studies that focus only on the 16S gene suffer from several inaccuracies compared to other, more expensive methods.\nFor one thing, this type of sequencing sees only the bacteria in a sample. Other important single-cell, invisible microbes won’t be detected: yeasts, fungi, and most archaea. Viruses, including phages that prey on bacteria, are also not part of the 16S summary.\nThe thousands of genes in each of the trillion bacteria in your system are doing important work that won’t be visible if we sequence a portion of just one of them. Much of the time, this doesn’t matter, because the vast majority of the unsequenced portion is genes that are identical to those that have already been sequenced by previous scientists. To use an analogy in the visible world, if you have identified that an organism is a bird, it’s very likely – though not certain – that it can fly. For nearly all bird species that would be a safe bet, but among the birds that actually matter to humans, you’d have an important detail wrong about chickens.\nOther problems with 16S microbiome testing technology: it’s limited in what it can see, and RNA itself is too unstable. One careful study concluded:\n\n“16s rRNA predicts genome-wide levels of similarity very well for distantly related prokaryotes, but not for closely related ones”2\n\nWorse, there are many important bacteria that share identical 16S sequences yet occupy entirely different ecological niches 3. Because the sequences are identical, different labs may arbitrarily assign different names to the same organism. 4\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Limitations of collection\nAnother source of possible error depends on how the sample was collected, and how it was handled after collection. The gold standard of collection requires a subject to be physically present in a lab, where the sample is collected and sequenced immediately, or else quickly frozen and then pulverized into tiny pieces that are carefully blended and then sequenced. Not only is that expensive, but it requires the subject to “poop on demand”, which isn’t always feasible. A common alternative asks the subject to place all or a scoop of the sample into a freezer which is sent to the lab later.\nMost home-based collection methods require you to collect a tiny swab of material which is then placed in a vial for shipment through the mail. The vial usually contains a special buffering chemical that keeps any DNA inert during transit. Because DNA is generally pretty stable, a vial preserved this way can usually remain usable for months or even years at room temperature.\nHow much does that affect the final result?\nSeveral studies have tried to compare collection methods, with mixed results. The most systematic study, performed by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control tested 8 hospital patients.5 Collecting samples from the bowel movements as well as rectal swabs inserted up the you-know-where at specific time periods, the researchers concluded that the differences within an individual are much smaller than the differences between individuals. In other words, although a single sample may have some variability depending on exactly where you swab, it won’t matter if you’re comparing to somebody else.\nI tried several different ways of collecting samples, and discovered that the results do indeed depend greatly on the sampling conditions. See my detailed results in the Experiments: collection chapter.\n\nThe above limitations are important, and there’s no question that you should keep them in mind when exploring your own microbiome, but the low price and accessibility of the technology makes up for it in many important applications.\nThans to these new machines originally developed for mass DNA sequencing, the process of finding and understanding microbes has been revolutionized. It’s now possible to search for new life forms without growing them in a culture, and this has made possible a major shift in how to think about life —and what is important and special about human hardware.\nUnlike the genetic discoveries you can make by understanding your DNA (from a low-cost consumer service like 23andme), much of the news from the microbial world is actionable. There’s little, if anything, you can do if you find you have a particular type of gene that gives you, say, a propensity to alzheimers for example. But because the microbes around you are constantly changing anyway, and because you can influence which ones grow and which don’t, the world of the human micro biome is eminently actionable.\n\n\n\n\nBassis, Christine M., Nicholas M.

More generally, among the kinds of plants and animals we encounter in the visible world, the term “species” refers broadly to organisms that can mate with one another to produce offspring of the same kind. Cats and dogs are different species because they can’t mate with each other.\nBut bacteria don’t mate: they reproduce by dividing themselves in half. So how do we define a species? In fact, even terms like “parent” or “child” aren’t quite appropriate if each new cell is an identical copy of the old one. For very broad categories, like phylum or even genus, the similarities among like cells is high enough that we feel comfortable grouping them together with a common name, but at what point do we reach the lowest, most specific level.\nThe answer is tricky for another reason, called horizontal gene transfer, a process by which sometimes (in fact, quite often), a microbe will absorb genes from nearby organisms, altering its genome and its corresponding functions, sometimes significantly. Once that happens, the resulting new microbe can itself divide indefinitely, producing more and more copies of itself with the new gene. Although the new microbes still mostly resemble their original ancestor, if the new gene makes a protein that affects your body somehow, it might as well be an entirely different species."

    "section": "10.1 Summary of My Experiments",
    "text": "10.1 Summary of My Experiments\nDuring the period from 2014 through early 2019, I sequenced over 600 samples of my microbiome. Inspired by the experiment in a 2014 paper by David Lawrence3, during most of that time I also carefully tracked the food I ate, my sleep, and other variables like activity or location. Most of my near-daily samples were of my gut, but I also regularly tested my skin, nose, and mouth. Since I’m generally healthy, I didn’t have a specific goal in mind other than to try to understand better what these microbes are doing, so many of my tests were taken while undergoing simple experiments, like eating a specific type of food or visiting a new location. While not necessarily up to the rigorous standards of a formal scientific trial, these “n of 1” studies on myself helped me discover several new interesting facts about my own microbiome, many of which appear to contradict other published studies. In addition, hundreds of people sent me their own test results, letting me compare many different microbiomes. And of course, I also followed the latest developments in scientific publications and the general press as I eagerly tried to learn more.\nWhat follows is a brief overview of some of the key things I learned.\n\nThe microbiome is highly variable from day to day, often moving in ways that appear indistinguishable from random.\nBroad trends are there if you look closely. I found many intriguing new results.\nIt is possible to change your microbiome in specific circumstances.\nPeople’s microbiomes are frustratingly different from one another. A feature that seems to be true about one person may not apply to another.\n\n\n10.1.1 Diversity\nThe general consensus is that diversity is good: a greater variety of microbes ensures more resilience against the daily threat of invaders. Many people, after taking just one test, often feel either reassured that their diversity is “good” or disappointed that it’s “bad”. But I find that day-to-day variability is high enough that it’s almost never useful to use a single result. For example, here’s my diversity during a typical week: (Figure 10.1))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Diversity changes significantly day-to-day.\n\n\n\n\nIf Monday were my only test, I may have been disappointed with my 1.83 score. Wait another day or two and, with no significant changes in diet, I was up to 2.29 – before plunging to 1.78 by the weekend. Moral: don’t take a single result too seriously.\nTo get a sense of how much diversity can vary over a year (Figure 10.2))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Gut diversity varies day-to-day but holds to a recognizable range within a single individual\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI found high daily variability to be the case for just about every microbe that you’ll find mentioned in popular books or articles. Here are two more examples:\nAkkermansia is a well-studied microbe due to its important role in degrading the mucin that lines the colon. There is only one known species of Akkermansia that inhabits human guts, Akkermansia muciniphila, so this is one of those cases when knowing the genus level is a pretty good approximation of what’s happening. Here are my levels over a typical month, with the blue line indicating the moving average.4.\nI tend to have a much higher average abundance than most people. Later I’ll explain why I think that’s true, but first let’s look at another important microbe.\nBifidobacterium is a key component of virtually all popular probiotic supplements, partly because it is so easy to manufacture, but also due to its proven association with sleep and other aspects of health. A six month picture of my levels shows some dramatic ups and downs. (Figure Figure 10.3).\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Bifidobacterum levels over time. Red dots indicate period of taking probiotic supplements.\n\n\nIncidentally, the red dots indicate days when I was taking a powerful probiotic supplement that contained Bifidobacterium. And that big spike in September? That was during a trip to New Orleans, when I ate a lot of red beans and rice. At least for me, food seems to work better than taking supplements.\nWhat else did I discover? Here I get to the fun and rewarding parts of these experiments, because I did find several interesting microbes that are apparently unknown to science but that had a clear relationship to my activities.\nThe first is the yogurt drink kefir. Google the phrase “one of the most potent probiotic foods available” and you’ll find kefir in all the top results. A BBC documentary that tested people after consuming different types of “gut-friendly” foods found that kefir had by far the biggest effect. My interest piqued when, after my disappointment with kombucha, I spoke with a man who happened to mention his good luck with kefir as a solution to his many gut issues. On a doctor’s recommendation, he tried kefir for a number of years with limited success, until — frustrated with the $3/day expense of buying it at Trader Joe’s — he began making it himself at home. “What a difference!” he claimed.\nDid it work for me? Yes! I found a very noticeable change in my gut microbiome — the most significant I’ve seen among my many experiments. Here’s what I found when I had the kefir drink sequenced:\nLook at my levels of Lactococcus, the main genus of microbe known to be found in kefir, and compare to what I saw in my gut biome:\n\n\n\nLactococus abundance noticably shoots up after days when I drink kefir.\n\n\nThe blue dots in the chart are days when I drank kefir. Since I sample near-daily over the entire chart, we can see that Lactococcus suddenly appeared shortly after I began to consume kefir. I had almost none beforehand. Also note that the levels seem to dip when I go for a few days without drinking any, such as during my business trips out of town in mid-March and another in early-April.\nI was even able to find a new microbe, Fusicatenibactor that appears to exactly trace my kefir consumption.\nI could find nothing in the literature that associates this microbe with kefir drinking. Though it appeared in me only after I started kefir, I found this microbe to be reasonably common among the hundreds of other samples people have sent, healthy and not, young and old. Why do I suddenly have it when I start drinking kefir, and why do others – even non-kefir drinkers – seem to have it? A mystery! Definitely something of scientific interest, though, and worthy of further investigation.\nHere’s another odd microbe I found, this time during a trip to Beijing China (the red line):\nI had none of this during my years of testing, but it suddenly appeared during the trip – and disappeared promptly afterward. Interestingly, although this microbe appears occasionally in the hundreds of other samples I’ve seen, there is no clear pattern, and never in the levels that appeared in mine. I couldn’t find any at all in the guts of two individuals I know who had been traveling in Asia.\n\n\n10.1.2 Variability through time\nLike most westerners, the vast majority of my gut is composed of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with an occasional spike of Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria or Verrucomicrobia. You can see a detailed summary in the Appendix"

    "text": "10.2 Conclusions\nAre these results are meaningful enough to be worthy of further analysis? How representative were these samples of my microbiome at the time? I submit only a tiny swab to uBiome’s lab; are the bacteria distributed evenly enough that the size or location of the sample doesn’t matter? Would I get similar results if I submitted two tests from slightly different sites on the same sample?\nThe answers to all these questions are unclear, but while we need to take these concerns seriously, my experience over many samples is that the uBiome results are consistent enough that, yes, the conclusions are actionable as long as we keep the limitations in mind. Here’s why I think so:\nFirst, my results are consistent with other “healthy omnivore” submissions that uBiome has received from others with diets and health histories similar to mine. I would be concerned if, for example, my firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio were reversed.\nSecond, 16S technology has proven accuracy when identifying unique organisms, so I can generally trust information about the overall level of diversity regardless of specific proportions. Since diversity tends to correlate with health – and is manipulable based on what I eat – my own experience shows that the changes I see in these results go up and down consistently in the expected way. Even if specific points on my microbiome map are fuzzy, the overall landmarks appear to be solid.\n\n\n\n\nDavid, Lawrence A., Arne C. Materna, Jonathan Friedman, Maria I. Campos-Baptista, Matthew C.
